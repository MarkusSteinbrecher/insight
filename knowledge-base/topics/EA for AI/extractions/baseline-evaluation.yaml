    rationale: "Baseline source 4 notes 70% of projects stall, but the specific architecture-readiness percentages (22% ready, 23% data-connected) from large-sample surveys are not in the baseline."

    rationale: "No baseline source discusses the service-as-a-software pricing model or the shift from per-seat licensing to outcome-based pricing for AI agents."

    rationale: "The copilot-to-autopilot maturity progression with a three-tier autonomy framework adds specificity beyond the baseline's general agentic AI adoption theme."
