    statement: "TOGAF's ADM is too slow for AI-driven transformation -- by the time a full ADM cycle completes, the AI landscape has shifted"

      TOGAF isn't widely used. Most organisations don't use TOGAF formally.
      The insight about governance speed is valid regardless of framework.

  - finding_id: cc-004
    statement: "SLMs outperform LLMs for domain-specific tasks; right-sizing models is more important than defaulting to the largest available"

      Multi-model is common. Sophisticated orgs already do this.
      The insight is still worth stating for those who haven't caught up.

  - finding_id: cc-016
    statement: "Foundation models commoditize; competitive advantage lies in proprietary data, domain expertise, and integration quality"

      Novel enough as-is. The commoditization angle is fresh and useful framing.

  - finding_id: cc-026
    statement: "MCP/A2A protocols are necessary for agent interoperability and vendor-neutral agent communication"
    original_verdict: genuine_insight

      Recommend the pattern, not the protocol. Abstract the communication layer.
      Specific protocols (MCP, A2A) will evolve -- the architectural principle
      of protocol abstraction is what matters.
    framing_note: "Present as architectural pattern (protocol abstraction layer) rather than endorsing specific protocols"

  - finding_id: cc-031
    statement: "Redesign processes for agent strengths rather than automating existing human workflows"

      Mostly bolting on. True process redesign is rare in practice.
      Most orgs are bolting AI agents onto existing workflows, not redesigning.
      This makes the insight more valuable, not less -- it identifies the gap.

  - finding_id: cc-089
    statement: "Model size does not equal business value; multi-component architectures with right-sized models outperform monolithic large models"
    original_verdict: genuine_insight

    user_assessment: merge

      Merge with cc-004. Same insight about right-sizing models.
      cc-004 (SLMs outperform LLMs for domain tasks) and cc-089 (model size ≠ value)
      are the same fundamental point expressed differently.
    merge_target: cc-004
    revised_verdict: null

  - finding_id: cc-098
    statement: "AI-augmented architects are notified during or before decision points, with agents pre-checking submissions and surfacing context at the point of decision"
    original_verdict: genuine_insight
    scores: { generality: 3, actionability: 7, novelty: 7 }
    user_assessment: keep
    user_notes: |
      Mostly aspirational. EA repositories and tooling aren't mature enough
      to make this work in practice today. Nice vision but the prerequisites
      (structured EA repos, well-defined standards) are rarely in place.
      Worth stating as aspiration even if current feasibility is limited.
    revised_verdict: null

  - finding_id: cc-100
    statement: "AI should be applied to processes, not to people or organisations; solid well-defined processes are a prerequisite"
    original_verdict: genuine_insight
    scores: { generality: 3, actionability: 7, novelty: 6 }
    user_assessment: keep
    user_notes: |
      Process first is correct. Organisations that skip process understanding
      consistently fail at AI automation.
