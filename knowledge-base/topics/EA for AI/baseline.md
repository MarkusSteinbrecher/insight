# Topic Baseline: EA for AI

Search question: "How does Enterprise Architecture change because of AI?"

## Key themes from baseline search

- **AI automates core EA tasks** — system analysis, documentation, impact assessments, and portfolio management are being accelerated from weeks to hours
- **EA is shifting from documentation to real-time governance** — continuous, data-driven architecture management replaces periodic review cycles
- **Agentic AI is the next architectural pattern** — AI agents are moving from experimental chatbots to production workforce participants, requiring new orchestration and management approaches
- **Data architecture is the prerequisite** — AI adoption at scale depends on data quality, integration, and governance foundations that most organisations lack
- **TOGAF and traditional frameworks are adapting** — blended approaches outperform pure methodology adherence; frameworks are incorporating AI ethics and governance checkpoints
- **Most enterprise architectures are not AI-ready** — roughly 70% of GenAI projects stall at pilot stage because infrastructure was not designed for intelligence at scale
- **The architect role is evolving** — from periodic reviewers producing static blueprints to augmented, real-time advisors supported by AI agents
- **Hybrid and convergent infrastructure** — on-prem and cloud are converging into unified architectural backbones; sovereign AI and edge computing add new concerns

## 1. [AI in Enterprise Architecture: Strategy, Design & Impact (2026)](https://www.stack-ai.com/blog/the-role-of-ai-in-enterprise-architecture)

AI is changing Enterprise Architecture by automating analysis, improving data quality, speeding up collaboration, and helping teams adapt faster. AI automates key enterprise architecture tasks such as system analysis, documentation, and impact assessments — what once took weeks now completed in hours.

2026 marks the transition from experimentation to intelligence orchestration, where AI, data, infrastructure, and governance converge into a single operating model. After years of tension between on-prem control and cloud elasticity, 2026 is the year of true convergence — hybrid infrastructure becomes the architectural backbone.

AI rapidly synthesizes what's running, what's outdated, and what overlaps — highlighting what needs attention in application portfolios and process designs. AI-driven tools automatically suggest design patterns, identify duplicate systems, and flag risks.

## 11. [AI-Powered Enterprise Architecture: A Strategic Imperative](https://www.architectureandgovernance.com/artificial-intelligence/ai-powered-enterprise-architecture-a-strategic-imperative/)

EA becoming AI-powered with automated analysis and decision support. Architecture function must itself adopt AI to remain relevant.

## 12. [The Augmented Architect: Real-Time Enterprise Architecture In The Age Of AI](https://www.forrester.com/blogs/the-augmented-architect-real-time-enterprise-architecture-in-the-age-of-ai/)

Rather than episodic review and disconnected models, the EA function operates in real time, continuously enriched by machine-readable data and supported by intelligent agents that advise, validate, and even act. This is augmentation — architects remain in the loop, but the loop is smaller, faster, and smarter.
