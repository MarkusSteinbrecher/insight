## Summary

EY's annual Top 10 Opportunities report identifies AI velocity as the defining competitive factor for 2026. Organizations capable of rapid innovation adoption while maintaining governance and interoperability will capture disproportionate market advantages.

Three primary strategic focus areas: enterprise-wide AI value creation, next-generation agentic ecosystems, and outcome-based business models.

The top 10 opportunities: (1) Scale through M&A and JV ecosystem strategies; (2) Design for agentic interoperability and physical AI; (3) Operationalize safe, reliable AI across functions; (4) Rethink commercial strategies for agentic solutions; (5) Optimize flexibility in model selection; (6) Embed sovereignty-by-default frameworks; (7) Deploy forward-deployed technical specialists; (8) Revise tax strategies for digital infrastructure; (9) Institutionalize AI FinOps as ROI mechanism; (10) Redefine enterprise security for AI and nation-state threats.

Companies are advised to pursue opportunistic M&A to secure data and capabilities, implement "sovereignty-by-default" frameworks, and adopt borderless talent strategies. Embedding governance and ecosystem alignment creates resilient, adaptive systems.

## Key Takeaways

- AI velocity is the defining competitive factor for 2026
- Agentic interoperability and physical AI require proactive design
- Sovereignty-by-default frameworks recommended for all new systems
- AI FinOps positioned as key ROI measurement mechanism
- Enterprise security must be redefined for AI and nation-state threats
