## Key Takeaways

- Explores how EA facilitates seamless Gen AI adoption by aligning information systems, business processes, and technology frameworks
- Analyzes three primary architectural patterns for AI integration: Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA), Event-Driven Architecture (EDA), and Microservices
- Proposes a phased implementation: use case identification → organizational readiness assessment → technology selection → pilot testing → scaling
- Addresses the critical challenge of integrating Gen AI into legacy systems
- Identifies emerging trends in AI regulations, industry collaborations, and technological advancements

## Summary

This 2025 IEEE conference paper examines how established enterprise architecture patterns can be leveraged to facilitate generative AI adoption within enterprises. The research evaluates three architectural approaches — SOA, EDA, and Microservices — for their suitability in supporting AI integration, with attention to how legacy systems can be modernized to accommodate Gen AI workloads.

The paper proposes a phased implementation approach that moves from use case identification through organizational readiness assessment, technology selection, pilot testing, and eventual scaling. This methodical approach aligns with the broader consensus across our sources that enterprises should progress incrementally rather than attempting wholesale transformation.

The inclusion of change management, governance frameworks, and continuous monitoring protocols alongside the technical architecture patterns reflects a mature understanding that AI adoption is as much an organizational challenge as a technical one. The paper also addresses emerging AI regulatory trends, providing forward-looking guidance for compliance.

## Notable Quotes

> The framework explores how "enterprise architecture facilitates seamless Gen AI adoption by aligning information systems, business processes, and technology frameworks."

## Relevance to Topic

The most directly applicable paper for practitioners choosing between architectural patterns (SOA, EDA, Microservices) for AI integration. Bridges the gap between abstract EA frameworks and concrete implementation decisions, complementing the event-driven architecture emphasis in source 1 (Kumar).
