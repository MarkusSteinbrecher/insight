## Summary

This comprehensive report by Economist Impact, commissioned by Databricks, combines a global survey of 1,100 respondents (715 technical executives and 385 data/AI technologists) across 19 countries and eight industries with interviews from 28 C-suite executives. It provides a thorough assessment of enterprise AI implementation, covering adoption patterns, ROI strategies, infrastructure challenges, model selection, and governance frameworks. The report spans data engineering, data science, and enterprise architecture perspectives.

The central thesis is that while AI adoption is widespread (85% of organisations are using GenAI in at least one business function), most enterprises are unprepared for enterprise-wide deployment. Only 22% say their current architecture can support AI workloads without modifications, and only 37% of executives believe their GenAI applications are production-ready. The report identifies a critical need for infrastructure modernisation ("fixing the plumbing"), robust data governance, and a shift from internal productivity-focused use cases to external, revenue-generating applications.

The report covers five major themes: (1) AI's "unlock moment" with democratisation via natural language interfaces; (2) rewards and returns, where productivity gains are early wins but long-term value comes from revenue growth and business model innovation; (3) the infrastructure refit needed to support AI at scale, including data lakehouses and real-time processing; (4) finding competitive edge through mixing proprietary data with open- and closed-source models; and (5) guardrails and governance, including Centres of Excellence as "forcing functions" for coordination.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Enterprise architectures are woefully unprepared for AI**: Only 22% of organisations have architectures fully capable of supporting AI workloads, and 48% of data engineers spend most of their time resolving data source connections -- the equivalent of "Victorian-era plumbing" in a modern building.

2. **GenAI adoption is near-universal but production-readiness lags**: 85% of organisations are actively using GenAI, reaching 97% among companies with revenue over US$10bn, yet only 37% of executives (and just 29% of practitioners) believe their GenAI applications are production-ready.

3. **Proprietary data is the competitive differentiator**: Two-thirds of organisations see significant potential in integrating GenAI models with their own data. As foundation models commoditise, the "edge" comes from proprietary data and domain expertise, not the models themselves.

4. **ROI requires patience and strategic framing**: Revenue growth has been the least effective metric for justifying AI investment to date (only 19% of respondents). Leaders argue AI returns require a 3+ year timeline and should be measured through business model innovation, market positioning, and customer experience, not just productivity.

5. **Infrastructure needs an overhaul**: Real-time data processing (47%), robust data pipelines (42%), and security (39%) are the top architecture capability gaps. Companies are shifting to multi-cloud, data lakehouses, and unified platforms to support AI workloads.

6. **Centres of Excellence are emerging as governance enablers**: COEs serve as both brakes and accelerators -- enforcing guardrails while acting as "forcing functions" for AI delivery across the enterprise, bringing together multidisciplinary teams.

7. **The shift from internal to external AI use cases is underway**: By 2027, 99% of executives expect GenAI adoption across both internal and external use cases. External use cases are already showing outsized ROI compared to investment levels.

## Notable Quotes

> "You can have all the AI in the world, but if it's on a shaky data foundation, then it's not going to bring you any value." -- Carol Clements, chief digital and technology officer, JetBlue (p. 31)

> "GenAI is going to be a commodity embedded in everything, similarly to the internet, and the value will be in the business problems it helps solve." -- Darrin Vohs, global chief information officer, Molson Coors (p. 11)

> "There is no such thing as a technology strategy. There's only a business strategy that technology supports." -- Melissa Pint, chief digital information officer, Frontier (p. 24)

> "Most of the value that you see on AI is buried in the bottom. The top is immediate benefits like productivity, but that's the starting point. You've not gone into your core value chain, that's when you go beneath the iceberg. That is where your proprietary data is." -- Senthil Ramani, global lead, data and AI, Accenture (p. 37)

## Methodology / Framework

The report is based on:

1. **Global Survey**: 1,100 respondents (715 technical executives + 385 data/AI technologists) across 19 countries, 8 industries, fielded July-August 2024. Respondents from large enterprises (revenue US$500m+) or public sector. Roles include CIOs, CTOs, CDOs, enterprise architects, data scientists, and data engineers.

2. **Executive Interviews**: 28 C-suite executives from leading organisations across 11 industries and 10 countries.

3. **Five-Chapter Framework**:
   - Chapter 1 ("AI's Unlock Moment"): Adoption patterns, democratisation, risk-graded experimentation
   - Chapter 2 ("Rewards and Returns"): ROI strategies, productivity vs. revenue, data intelligence
   - Chapter 3 ("The Infrastructure Refit"): Architecture gaps, data management, cloud strategies
   - Chapter 4 ("Find Your Edge"): Model selection (open vs. closed-source), proprietary data integration, RAG
   - Chapter 5 ("Guardrails and Governance"): COEs, human-in-the-loop, regulatory compliance, talent

## Connections

- Relates to: Enterprise architecture transformation for AI, data infrastructure modernisation, AI governance frameworks, change management for AI adoption, multi-cloud strategy, data mesh/lakehouse architectures, AI talent strategy, RAG architectures
- Contradicts: The idea that simply adopting foundation models creates competitive advantage -- the report argues proprietary data and domain expertise are the differentiators; also challenges the notion that AI ROI should be measured in quarters rather than years
- Extends: McKinsey and Goldman Sachs research on AI spending and ROI, prior work on data architecture evolution (warehouses → lakes → lakehouses), Deloitte research on AI Centres of Excellence
