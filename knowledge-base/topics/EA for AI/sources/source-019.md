## Key Takeaways
- MIT CISR's Enterprise AI Maturity Model defines four stages measured by a "Total AI Effectiveness" score (0-100%), an equally weighted combination of AI effectiveness in improving operations, customer experience, and ecosystem development
- Enterprises in Stages 1-2 (score <75%) perform below industry average financially; Stages 3-4 (score 75-100%) significantly outperform peers
- The critical leap is from Stage 2 (piloting) to Stage 3 (scaling) -- where organizations must build scalable enterprise architecture as a platform for AI, enable data transparency via dashboards, and develop a pervasive test-and-learn culture
- Stage 4 ("AI Future-Ready") enterprises embed AI in all decision-making and commercialize their AI capabilities externally; only 7% of surveyed companies reach this level
- The model was developed from a 2022 survey of 721 companies

## Summary
The MIT Center for Information Systems Research (CISR) developed a four-stage Enterprise AI Maturity Model that provides a rigorous, research-backed framework for understanding how organizations progress in their AI adoption journey. The model moves from Stage 1 (Experiment with AI, 28% of enterprises) through Stage 2 (Pilot AI) and Stage 3 (Develop AI Ways of Working, 31% of enterprises) to Stage 4 (AI Future-Ready, only 7% of enterprises).

Each stage requires specific organizational capabilities. Stage 1 focuses on AI literacy for boards and management, identifying value-creation opportunities, and formulating AI policies. Stage 2 centers on defining metrics, simplifying and automating processes, and storytelling about pilot lessons learned. Stage 3 -- the most architecturally significant stage -- requires industrializing AI throughout the organization, building a scalable enterprise architecture (a platform for AI that allows for scaling and reusing models), making data and outcomes transparent, and developing a pervasive test-and-learn culture. Stage 4 involves embedding AI in all decision-making and selling AI capabilities as services.

The financial performance correlation is striking: the research demonstrates that moving from Stage 2 to Stage 3 is the critical inflection point where organizations transition from below-average to above-average financial performance. An updated 2025 version of the model further validates these findings and provides additional guidance on capability building.

## Notable Quotes
> "To get above-industry-average financial performance, enterprises need to move from AI pilots (stage 2) to scaling AI (stage 3)."

> "Financial performance improved at each stage, and enterprises pinpointed capabilities needed as they progress through the stages."

## Relevance to Topic
This is a foundational research-backed maturity model that directly connects enterprise architecture capability to AI success. The explicit identification of "scalable enterprise architecture" as a Stage 3 requirement validates the central thesis that EA is essential for AI at scale. The financial performance data provides compelling evidence for EA investment in the context of AI transformation. The model also provides a useful diagnostic framework for organizations to assess where they stand and what architectural capabilities they need to develop next.
