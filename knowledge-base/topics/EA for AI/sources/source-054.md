## Summary

PwC Switzerland's Sebastian Ahrens argues that AI-powered general-purpose chatbots are fundamentally transforming enterprise software adoption patterns. Unlike traditional SaaS tools serving specific functions, AI assistants follow an accelerated innovation cycle that democratizes access while creating governance challenges.

The article presents a five-stage Innovation Flywheel: (1) Individual Experimentation — employees use free/low-cost AI tools; (2) Use Case Discovery — novel productivity applications emerge organically; (3) Internal Advocacy — early adopters champion solutions to colleagues; (4) Enterprise Adoption — organizations invest in enterprise-grade versions with security and support; (5) Expanded Use Cases — full organizational deployment drives continuous improvement. This cycle generates feedback data that enhances AI models, restarting the flywheel at higher capability levels.

Key characteristics of AI adoption vs. traditional SaaS: universal applicability across all language and reasoning tasks, low barrier to entry with unlimited scaling potential, viral growth through demonstration and peer sharing, and continuous innovation through interaction-driven model improvement.

The governance implications include data security and compliance risks from uncontrolled adoption, the need for frameworks that enable rather than restrict innovation, and the imperative to proactively deliver enterprise-grade AI tools to prevent shadow adoption.
