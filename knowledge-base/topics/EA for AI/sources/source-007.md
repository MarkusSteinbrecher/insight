## Key Takeaways

- AI has transitioned from experimental technology to a strategic imperative within enterprise architecture
- TOGAF ADM phases can be augmented with AI: automated process mining (Phases B-C), compliance monitoring (Phase G), change management (Phase H)
- Gartner's TIME model (Tolerate/Invest/Migrate/Eliminate) provides a practical lens for categorizing IT assets for AI integration
- Hyperautomation combining AI, RPA, and low-code platforms creates end-to-end orchestration across business and IT
- The author proposes AI+HI=ECI (Elevated Collaborative Intelligence) as a model for balancing automation with human expertise

## Summary

This comprehensive article from The CDO Times examines how AI automation is reshaping enterprise architecture practice. The author maps AI capabilities onto established frameworks — particularly TOGAF's ADM phases and Gartner's TIME model — to show how existing EA methodologies can incorporate AI rather than being replaced.

The article is notable for its rich collection of real-world case study data. It cites P&G achieving ~$1 billion in annual savings from AI in supply chain, UPS saving $300-400 million/year from AI-driven route optimization, JPMorgan Chase's COIN system processing legal documents in seconds vs. 360,000 hours of lawyer time annually, and a global financial firm achieving 90% fewer errors with RPA implementation.

The piece also introduces the concept of "Elevated Collaborative Intelligence" (ECI = AI + HI) as a framework for how organizations should think about the balance between automation and human expertise. Rather than full automation, the recommendation is collaborative models where AI augments human decision-making through predictive analytics, scenario modeling, and risk simulation.

## Notable Quotes

> "AI is no longer an experimental technology reserved for tech startups and research labs — it has become an essential force driving enterprise architecture."

> "The challenge is no longer whether to adopt AI automation, but how to integrate AI efficiently."

## Relevance to Topic

Provides the practical "how-to" bridge between TOGAF/Gartner frameworks and AI integration, with concrete case study ROI data. Complements the academic critique of TOGAF in source 1 by showing how TOGAF can be adapted rather than replaced.
