## Summary

PwC Switzerland addresses how small and mid-sized enterprises can adopt enterprise architecture frameworks like TOGAF through pragmatic, scaled implementations rather than full enterprise-level deployments. The article presents a five-phase TOGAF methodology adapted for SMEs: Preliminary (document objectives and governance), Architecture Vision (short vision aligned with business goals), Business Architecture (map critical processes), Information Systems (identify applications and interface gaps), and Technology Architecture (evaluate deployment options).

Key recommendations for SMEs include: starting with modular implementations using low-tech solutions (Excel, Word templates) before adopting formal EA tooling; embracing open-source tools (ArchiMate, EA Navigator); building cross-functional teams combining business and IT leadership; implementing lightweight governance avoiding bureaucratic complexity; and developing EA capabilities gradually through targeted training and TOGAF Foundation certification.

The article acknowledges challenges including resource constraints, TOGAF's comprehensiveness potentially overwhelming smaller teams, rigid implementations disconnecting from business needs, and administrative overhead hindering agility. A manufacturing SME case study illustrates the pragmatic approach through cloud ERP adoption evaluation.

The "just enough architecture" methodology is advocated — defining only necessary components and building flexibility for growth.
