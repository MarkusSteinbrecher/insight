## Key Takeaways
- TOGAF's ADM was designed for a world where change happened in measured cycles, with ten phases presuming time for deliberation, stakeholder workshops, documentation cycles, and human decision checkpoints
- GenAI usage across businesses jumped from 33% to 78% in a single year, fundamentally invalidating the ADM's assumption of measured change cycles
- The velocity of technological change invalidates the underlying assumptions of traditional governance frameworks
- Organizations successfully integrating TOGAF with GenAI are radically adapting the ADM -- collapsing phases, running them in parallel, and treating the framework as principles rather than process
- Architectural technical debt from rapid GenAI innovation creates the "acceleration paradox" where slow governance cycles prevent organizations from capturing value
- Proposes that EA frameworks need to evolve from sequential process-driven approaches to principle-based, parallel-execution models for AI contexts

## Summary
This article examines the fundamental tension between TOGAF's Architecture Development Method and the velocity of generative AI adoption in enterprises. The author argues that the ADM's ten phases -- designed with the assumption that architectural change happens in deliberate, measured cycles with time for stakeholder workshops, documentation, and review -- are fundamentally misaligned with the speed at which GenAI transforms business capabilities.

The article documents how GenAI adoption has accelerated from 33% to 78% of businesses in a single year, and how AI applications now move from concept to production in weeks rather than quarters. This speed creates what the author calls a governance paradox: the very frameworks designed to ensure sound architectural decisions become impediments to capturing value from AI, as architectural decisions become obsolete before governance cycles complete.

However, the article is not an argument for abandoning governance. Instead, it examines how leading organizations are adapting TOGAF by collapsing ADM phases, running phases in parallel rather than sequentially, and treating the framework as a set of principles rather than a rigid process. This pragmatic adaptation preserves the governance intent while accommodating the velocity of AI innovation.

## Relevance to Topic
This article directly addresses one of the most important questions in EA for AI: how should traditional EA frameworks adapt to accommodate the speed of AI innovation? The identification of the governance paradox -- where governance frameworks designed for sound decisions become barriers to value capture -- is a critical insight for enterprise architects. The practical adaptation strategies (collapsing phases, parallel execution, principle-based approach) offer actionable guidance for organizations trying to maintain governance discipline while enabling AI agility.
