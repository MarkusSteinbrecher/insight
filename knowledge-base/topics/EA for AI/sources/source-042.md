## Summary

Published in conjunction with AWS re:Invent 2025, this article positions agentic AI as the beginning of a new enterprise paradigm where AI becomes the operating fabric of modern business. The next decade will be defined by a shift toward autonomous, adaptive, and self-optimizing systems.

Core argument: instead of relying on fragmented systems and manual orchestration, organizations can embed intelligence directly into workflows, creating an operating environment that adapts in real time and evolves alongside shifting market dynamics. Agentic AI marks a shift from static processes to dynamic, goal-oriented systems.

Two proprietary Capgemini frameworks: RAISE (Reliable AI Solution Engineering) — an accelerator for building, orchestrating, and monitoring AI agents; and the Resonance AI Framework — a strategic path for responsible AI adoption. AWS provides the technological core through Amazon Bedrock.

Five ways agentic AI redefines the enterprise: (1) anticipation over reaction — detecting change before it impacts operations; (2) real-time operational adaptation — adjusting workflows and rerouting processes dynamically; (3) accelerated decision cycles — from long manual cycles to minutes or seconds; (4) empowering people, not replacing them — augmentation over displacement; (5) building an autonomous enterprise — balancing strategy, governance, technology, and execution.

## Key Takeaways

- AI is becoming the operating fabric of modern business, not a supporting technology
- Agentic AI shifts enterprises from static processes to dynamic, goal-oriented systems
- Five enterprise redefinitions: anticipation, real-time adaptation, accelerated decisions, empowerment, autonomy
- Capgemini RAISE framework for building and monitoring AI agents at scale
- Partnership with AWS (Bedrock) as technological foundation
