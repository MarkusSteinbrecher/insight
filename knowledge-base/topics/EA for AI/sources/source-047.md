## Summary

KPMG argues that AI technologies, when embedded into enterprise transformation initiatives from inception, streamline complex change operations, reduce costs, and accelerate value creation. Rather than treating AI and digital transformation as separate initiatives, organizations should integrate them as complementary forces.

The article presents a three-layer composable architecture model powered by Intelligent Cloud: (1) the Engine Room (platforms layer) — virtual ERPs, CRMs, and data storage where AI automates legacy data extraction and generates dynamic segmentations; (2) the Cognitive Intelligence Layer (data and integration) — APIs, microservices, data pipelines, and event-driven technologies; (3) the Engagement Layer (connectivity and experience) — customer applications, predictive modeling, and GenAI-powered dashboards providing real-time visibility.

Four common transformation traps are identified with AI-enabled solutions: innovation execution (AI prioritizes by expected business value), data enhancement (intelligent architecture harnesses multi-system data), operations future-proofing (trusted AI framework with automated monitoring), and change management (cross-functional teams and upskilling commitments).

Nine in ten companies are now delivering improvements in profitability and performance from digital transformation initiatives.
