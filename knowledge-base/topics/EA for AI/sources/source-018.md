## Key Takeaways
- TOGAF Standard celebrated its 30th anniversary, marking the evolution from TOGAF to ArchiMate, Open Agile Architecture (O-AA), and the Eagle AI Assistant
- The Open Group is developing open standards for AI professional practice, backed by prominent organizations
- Key theme: "Architecture of Agency" — architects must stop solutioning for automation and start architecting for agency, using Work Areas as governed containers defined by Mandate, Governance, and Interface
- "Zero Risk" mandate testing reveals that agency is not monolithic — different mandates require different architectural approaches
- Transformation succeeds only when strategic intent is translated into executable EA, guided by sustainability principles, and accelerated by AI
- EA must evolve from "static blueprints to dynamic ecosystems" incorporating probabilistic modeling (Monte Carlo) and narrative-driven communication
- AI and sustainability emerged as the two dominant cross-cutting themes across all sessions
- PwC's Ben Lingwood presented on "Controls vs Speed: AI in the Enterprise" — balancing governance with agility
- The gap between abstract EA theory and practical application (the "Grenade" problem) remains a critical challenge

## Summary
The Open Group's EA Practitioners Conference in London (February 2-4, 2026) brought together over 90 attendees from around the world to mark the 30th anniversary of the TOGAF Standard and address the intersection of enterprise architecture with AI and sustainability. The conference revealed how the EA standards community is grappling with AI's impact on architecture practice.

A standout session was David Hornford's "Architecture of Agency: Flip the Script, Design the Work," which introduced the concept of Work Areas as governed containers for agency, defined by their Mandate, Governance, and Interface. His "hardest-first" stress test using a "Zero Risk" mandate demonstrated that agency is not monolithic — different risk profiles require different architectural designs. This represents a significant philosophical shift from traditional EA's focus on process automation to designing systems for autonomous agent behavior.

Stuart Macgregor's presentation on evolving from "Static Blueprints to Dynamic Ecosystems" highlighted the persistent gap between EA theory and practice (the "Grenade" problem), advocating for probabilistic modeling (Monte Carlo simulations) and narrative-driven approaches that move the "heart and mind" of the business. Other sessions addressed the TOGAF Standard's evolution, sustainability integration through the Open Footprint Data Model, and the role of EA standards in digital transformation.

The Open Group is also positioning itself in AI standards through its AI Initiatives program, the Eagle AI Assistant tool, and its Open Professions Program covering Enterprise Architects, Data Scientists, and Trusted Technology Providers — signaling the convergence of traditional EA standards with AI governance requirements.

## Relevance to Topic
This source provides critical insight into how the EA standards community (TOGAF, ArchiMate, Open Agile Architecture) is responding to AI. The "Architecture of Agency" concept — designing governed containers for autonomous agent behavior — directly addresses the architectural challenge of enterprise AI. The conference highlights reveal that while the standards community recognizes AI's transformative impact, there is still a significant gap between traditional EA frameworks and the dynamic, probabilistic, agent-driven architectures that AI demands. This tension between established standards and emerging AI requirements is central to the EA for AI topic.
