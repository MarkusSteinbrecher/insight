## Summary

A companion piece to the MIT Sloan Management Review / BCG survey of 2,000+ leaders across 100+ countries. The article argues that agentic AI is "both software and colleague" and that organizations must develop new management frameworks for workflows, governance, investment planning, and talent strategies.

Survey data: 35%+ of companies already deploy agentic AI systems capable of autonomous planning, action, and learning; 44% plan to implement them; 76% of executives view agentic AI more as a coworker than a tool. AI-native firms achieve 25 to 35 times more revenue per employee than traditional competitors.

The article identifies four organizational tensions: (1) Scalability vs. Adaptability — balancing machine efficiency with human flexibility; (2) Experience vs. Expediency — AI systems simultaneously depreciate through model drift while appreciating through learning; (3) Supervision vs. Autonomy — dynamic, risk-based governance is essential; (4) Retrofitting vs. Reimagining — quick retrofitting delivers faster but limited gains, while reimagining from first principles unlocks competitive advantage.

A five-dimension leadership playbook: reimagine the work (zero-based approach), guide actions not just decisions, rethink structures and talent (orchestrators not overseers), institutionalize learning loops, and build radical adaptability toward an "Agentic Enterprise Operating System."

## Key Takeaways

- Enthusiasm for agentic AI is running ahead of organizational readiness in governance, talent, and accountability
- Four organizational tensions: scalability vs. adaptability, experience vs. expediency, supervision vs. autonomy, retrofitting vs. reimagining
- AI-native firms achieve 25-35x more revenue per employee than traditional competitors
- Middle management layers will shrink; new roles emphasize orchestration over oversight
- The goal is an "Agentic Enterprise Operating System" where human creativity and machine initiative evolve together
- The 10/20/70 rule: 10% algorithms, 20% tech, 70% people and processes
