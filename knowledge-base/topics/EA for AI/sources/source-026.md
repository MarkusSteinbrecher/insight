## Key Takeaways
- AI sovereignty has moved from an IT concern to a board-level priority as AI becomes embedded in day-to-day business operations
- Enterprise Architecture is positioned as the function that turns high-level AI governance principles into deployable designs, enforceable controls, and auditable evidence
- Open, evidence-based frameworks (NIST + ISO/IEC 42001) can absorb new regulatory requirements without re-architecting the control model
- The EU AI Act takes effect February 2026, classifying AI systems into four risk categories and requiring specific governance responses
- EA must bridge the gap between regulatory requirements and technical implementation -- translating policy into architecture
- Five forces driving EA framework adoption: cost pressure, AI acceleration, cyber risk, regulation, and loss of tolerance for "architecture as theatre"

## Summary
This article examines how enterprise architecture serves as the critical bridge between AI governance aspirations and operational reality, with a particular focus on AI sovereignty. The author argues that as AI becomes woven into day-to-day business operations, AI sovereignty -- the ability to maintain control over AI systems, data, and decision-making -- has moved from a technical concern to a board-level strategic priority. Enterprise Architecture is uniquely positioned to translate high-level governance principles into deployable designs, enforceable controls, and auditable evidence.

The article emphasizes the regulatory landscape, particularly the EU AI Act (effective February 2026) which classifies AI systems into four risk categories. EA must provide the structural framework for organizations to classify their AI systems, implement appropriate controls, and demonstrate compliance. The recommendation to build on open, evidence-based frameworks like NIST AI RMF and ISO/IEC 42001 is practical -- these frameworks are designed to absorb new regulatory requirements without requiring wholesale re-architecting of the control model.

A particularly sharp observation is that five forces have converged to make EA frameworks essential rather than optional: cost pressure, AI acceleration, cyber risk, regulation, and the loss of organizational tolerance for "architecture as theatre." This last point -- the demand for EA to deliver tangible value rather than producing artifacts -- reflects a broader maturation of the EA discipline under AI-driven pressure.

## Relevance to Topic
This source provides an important perspective on the governance dimension of EA for AI, particularly around regulatory compliance and AI sovereignty. The framing of EA as the bridge between governance principles and technical implementation is central to the EA for AI thesis. The regulatory focus (EU AI Act, NIST, ISO/IEC 42001) adds a compliance dimension that is increasingly critical for enterprise AI deployments. The observation about the end of "architecture as theatre" captures a broader shift in how organizations value and hold accountable their EA functions in the AI era.
