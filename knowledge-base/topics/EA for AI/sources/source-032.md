## Summary

BCG Platinion argues for a new organizational role — the Enterprise AI Architect — to coordinate enterprise-wide AI initiatives while balancing business requirements with technical capabilities and governance policies. The authors observe that decentralized AI implementations create inefficiencies: poor data quality, wrong integration mechanisms, and suboptimal exposure to the business all undermine results. They cite that 89% of C-level executives ranked AI among their top three 2024 priorities and that global corporate AI investments totaled $92 billion in 2022 alone.

The article identifies five critical questions organizations must address: where AI is most useful (value assurance), which solutions best fit specific needs (model governance), what existing infrastructure can be leveraged (platform foundations), whether quality data is available (data governance), and how AI should integrate into existing processes (delivery approach).

The proposed Enterprise AI Architect role requires technical competencies spanning AI solutions market knowledge, integration approaches, model management, data management, deployment scaling, model observability and drift detection, and responsible AI principles. Equally important is business acumen — understanding strategic objectives, existing processes, IT environments, and quick-win opportunities. The authors stress collaboration with data engineers, data scientists, and governance representatives as essential.

## Key Takeaways

- Decentralized AI adoption without architectural coordination leads to poor outcomes — integration failures, data quality issues, and suboptimal business exposure
- The Enterprise AI Architect role sits at the intersection of business strategy, technical AI capabilities, and governance policy
- Five critical questions (value, model governance, platforms, data, delivery) provide a structured framework for enterprise AI planning
- 89% of C-level executives ranked AI among top three 2024 priorities; $92B in global corporate AI investment in 2022
- The role's organizational positioning depends on company context — could sit within EA, a dedicated AI function, or elsewhere
- Early movers in establishing this role gain a significant head start in optimizing AI investment allocation

## Notable Quotes

- "Poor data quality, wrong integration mechanisms, and suboptimal exposure to the business will all have a detrimental impact on results."
- "Corporations that are first in establishing such a role the right way will gain a significant head start in the AI race."
