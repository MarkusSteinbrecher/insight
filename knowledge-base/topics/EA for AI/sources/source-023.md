## Key Takeaways
- Theorizes Enterprise Architecture Management (EAM) as a dynamic capability (sensing, seizing, transforming) that enables scalable and sustainable GenAI adoption
- Based on systematic literature review and qualitative analysis of 16 semi-structured expert interviews using the Gioia methodology
- Identifies critical enablers and barriers to GenAI adoption across industries
- Reveals key limitations in existing EA frameworks (particularly TOGAF) -- their inability to fully address unique GenAI requirements including ethical governance, lifecycle artifacts, and the speed of AI-driven transformation
- Proposes extensions to EA frameworks to meet the needs of automation, AI, and digital governance
- Finds that organizations with clean, modular architectures can leverage GenAI to accelerate development 30-50%, while those with legacy systems are trapped in governance cycles too slow to capture value
- Identifies "the acceleration paradox": architectural technical debt from rapid GenAI innovation creates a self-reinforcing gap between leaders and laggards

## Summary
This academic paper examines how Enterprise Architecture Management can serve as a dynamic capability for organizations seeking to adopt Generative AI at scale. Using the dynamic capabilities framework (sensing, seizing, transforming), the research investigates how EAM can enhance strategic alignment, governance frameworks, and organizational agility for GenAI adoption. The study is grounded in both a systematic literature review and 16 semi-structured interviews with industry experts, analyzed using the Gioia methodology.

The paper reveals an important tension: while EA frameworks like TOGAF provide valuable governance structures, they lack the agility, ethical governance mechanisms, and lifecycle artifacts needed for AI-driven transformation. The research identifies what it calls "the acceleration paradox" -- organizations with clean, modular architectures can leverage GenAI to accelerate development by 30-50%, but those navigating legacy systems find themselves trapped in ADM cycles that are too slow to capture value before the next wave of AI innovation renders their architectural decisions obsolete. This creates a widening gap between architectural leaders and laggards.

Key findings include the need to tailor EA frameworks to GenAI-specific challenges such as low data governance maturity, the balance between innovation and compliance, and the requirement for new architectural patterns that accommodate rapid experimentation alongside enterprise-grade governance. The paper proposes specific extensions to existing frameworks to bridge these gaps.

## Relevance to Topic
This paper is directly at the heart of the EA for AI research topic. It provides academic rigor and expert interview data to validate the hypothesis that traditional EA frameworks need significant adaptation for AI adoption. The dynamic capabilities lens (sensing, seizing, transforming) offers a theoretical framework for understanding how EA creates value in the AI context. The identification of the "acceleration paradox" and the 30-50% development acceleration for architecturally mature organizations provides both a cautionary tale and an aspirational target. The proposed TOGAF extensions offer a concrete path forward for framework evolution.
