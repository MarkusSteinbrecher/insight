## Summary

This paper proposes the Agentic AI-enabled Business Modelling Architecture (ABMA), a modular, AI-driven system designed to automate the generation of Business Architecture (BA) artefacts -- specifically business capability models (BCMs). The authors argue that current BA methods are largely manual, static, and time-consuming, producing artefacts that quickly become outdated in dynamic business environments. While LLMs have shown promise in generating BA artefacts through prompting techniques, they are prone to hallucination and lack semantic grounding. The ABMA addresses these limitations by integrating multi-agent orchestration (using Microsoft's AutoGen 0.2 framework) with an Enterprise Knowledge Graph (EKG) hosted on Stardog to provide semantic validation and organisational context.

The system architecture comprises five layers: user interaction, context extraction, orchestration, processing, and knowledge. Specialized agents (entity agent, capability agent, value stream agent, value map agent, mapping agent) handle different aspects of BA artefact generation. The paper demonstrates the approach through two configurations: one using LLM-only agents with Tree-of-Thought (ToT) prompting, and a second integrating the Capsifi BA ontology and EKG for semantic validation. The EKG-enhanced configuration showed improved semantic alignment of generated capabilities, though matching was limited to Level 1 capabilities in the current prototype.

This is a work-in-progress research project conducted in partnership with Capsifi Pvt. Ltd. (an industry BA modelling platform) and the University of Technology Sydney, using Design Science Research methodology. The authors plan to extend the system to additional BA artefact types and deeper capability hierarchy levels, with the goal of producing a practitioner-ready tool for automated, context-aware BA modelling.

## Key Takeaways

1. Traditional Business Architecture methods produce static artefacts that become outdated quickly; agentic AI offers a path to dynamic, automated BA artefact generation that can keep pace with evolving business environments.

2. Integrating Enterprise Knowledge Graphs (EKGs) with LLM-based agents significantly improves the semantic accuracy and organisational relevance of generated BA artefacts, compared to using LLMs with prompt engineering alone.

3. The Tree-of-Thought (ToT) prompting technique improves LLM reasoning for capability map generation by allowing exploration of multiple solution paths in parallel, but without external knowledge grounding, the outputs remain semantically unverified.

4. The proposed ABMA architecture is modular and extensible -- specialized agents can be added for different BA artefact types (capability maps, value stream maps, application portfolios), each interacting with LLMs and validated against domain ontologies and EKGs.

5. In the EKG-enhanced configuration, only Level 1 capabilities ("Claims Management") matched the enterprise knowledge graph, revealing a current limitation: deeper capability hierarchies (Levels 2-5) generated by the LLM do not yet align with existing organisational ontologies.

6. The research demonstrates a human-in-the-loop design where users provide natural language queries and receive structured BA artefacts with feedback and refinement capabilities, positioning AI as a "copilot" rather than a fully autonomous system.

## Notable Quotes

> "Current methods in BA artefact generation and maintenance are largely manual, static, and time-consuming, which limits their effectiveness in dynamic and complex decision-making environments." (p. 1)

> "Agentic AI offers an alternative approach to LLM-based BA modelling, due to its ability to make autonomous decisions, adapt through learning, and process data in real-time." (p. 1)

> "This hybrid approach combines the generative strength of the LLM with the semantic control of structured enterprise knowledge, resulting in accurate and context-aware BA modelling, which leads to increased trust in the generated model." (p. 4)

> "Configuration 1 performed better at creative, unconstrained generation of the capability map, but was semantically unverified. Configuration 2 offered semantic alignment and potential ontology alignment of capabilities, but it is limited to level 1." (p. 8)

## Data Points

- The prototype was implemented using AutoGen 0.2 (Microsoft's multi-agent orchestration framework) with GPT-4o via the OpenAI API.
- The demonstration generated a 5-level capability map for the insurance industry in Japan.
- In Configuration 2 (EKG-enhanced), only the Level 1 capability "Claims Management" matched the enterprise knowledge graph; all Level 2 and Level 3 sub-capabilities returned "No" for EKG matching (Table 2, p. 7).
- Configuration 1 (ToT-prompted, no EKG) generated capabilities like "Claims Submission," "Claims Settlement," "Claims Assistance," and "Claims Intake" -- semantically plausible but unverified against organisational standards.
- The paper references 21 sources spanning enterprise architecture, agentic AI, LLMs, and design science research.

## Methodology / Framework

The research uses **Design Science Research (DSR)** following the Tuunanen et al. (2024) hierarchy, comprising four stages: (1) Problem Analysis -- identifying the static nature of traditional BA methods; (2) Objectives and Requirements Definition -- exploring how agentic AI can automate BA artefacts; (3) Design and Development -- iteratively building and refining ABMA; (4) Demonstration -- presenting scenario illustrations and preliminary results.

The **ABMA framework** itself consists of five layers:
- **User Interaction Layer**: Natural language prompt and feedback interfaces.
- **Context Extraction Layer**: Entity agent parses queries to extract industry, artefact type, region, and hierarchy levels, grounded by a reference ontology.
- **Orchestration Layer**: Routes parsed entities to the appropriate specialized agent (capability, value stream, value map, or mapping agent).
- **Processing Layer**: Specialized agents interact with LLMs to generate artefacts, validated against domain ontologies and EKGs.
- **Knowledge Layer**: Backend comprising enterprise knowledge graphs, APIs, templates, and databases for semantic grounding.

Two configurations were tested: (1) agents using only LLM with ToT prompting; (2) agents augmented with Capsifi's CAPSICUM ontology and EKG hosted on Stardog for semantic validation via RDF/SPARQL queries.

## Connections

- Relates to: Enterprise Architecture for AI adoption, AI-augmented decision-making, TOGAF business architecture, knowledge graph applications in enterprise contexts, multi-agent system design patterns, prompt engineering for structured output generation.
- Contradicts: The implicit assumption in many LLM-based tools that prompt engineering alone is sufficient for reliable enterprise artefact generation -- this paper demonstrates the need for external semantic grounding via knowledge graphs.
- Extends: Prior work by the same authors on reasoning-based prompting techniques for BA artefact generation (Oaj et al., 2025), the CAPSICUM semantic framework for business architecture (Roach, 2011), and the Tree-of-Thought prompting method (Yao et al., 2023).
