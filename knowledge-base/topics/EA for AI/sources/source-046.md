## Summary

KPMG's Global Tech Report 2026, based on a survey of 2,500 technology executives across 27 countries and 8 industries, examines how organizations balance ambitious technology adoption with disciplined execution. The report identifies four core themes: meeting intelligence-age challenges despite tech debt and talent shortages; building adaptive strategies that survive rapid disruption cycles; realizing value from technology investments through governance and agility; and preparing for future disruptions including agentic AI, quantum computing, and AGI.

The survey finds 88% of organizations are already embedding AI agents into workflows and products. High performers expect approximately 50% of tech teams to remain permanent human staff by 2027, with the remainder augmented through AI-powered ecosystems. ROI varies dramatically based on readiness, governance, and execution discipline, with many AI investment decisions still relying on indirect benefits rather than measurable KPIs.

The report recommends accelerating organizational learning, building agent-empowered workforces, maintaining continuous monitoring of emerging technologies, updating ROI measurement frameworks for AI capabilities, and implementing governance discipline.
