## Summary

EY documents its internal AI transformation as "Client Zero" — testing AI deployment internally before advising clients. The initiative was backed by a $1.4 billion commitment and addressed six critical obstacles: POC fatigue (scattered initiatives), upskilling gaps, regulatory complexity, operational harmonization across decentralized global teams, market pressure, and technology integration.

Six strategic transformation pillars: (1) Strategy — mapped 800+ AI use cases down to 20 key opportunities, accelerated decision-making to 8-10 weeks; (2) Technology — centralized AI consumption via "EY Fabric" platform, launched "EY.ai EYQ" GenAI ecosystem in 4 weeks with agents, assistants, and prompt management, supporting 850+ Azure OpenAI instances; (3) People — 83% workforce AI learning completion, 115,000+ AI badges, 2 million learning hours; (4) Responsible AI governance — 7 high-level and 44 detailed process flows, 152 governance artifacts, analysis of 17,000+ historical AI entries; (5) Client-facing innovation — client labs for co-investment, alternative commercial models; (6) AI for social good — contributions to G7 principles and EU AI Act.

Key metrics: 81% EY.ai EYQ adoption, 85 million+ prompts processed in 9 months, 4.1 million lines of developer code, 400,000 total workforce.
