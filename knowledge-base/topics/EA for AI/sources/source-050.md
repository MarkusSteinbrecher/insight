## Summary

PwC's survey of 1,415 business and technology leaders across 26 EMEA territories examines how cloud strategy is evolving under the pressures of geopolitics, regulation, rising costs, and agentic AI. Cloud has matured from flexible IT infrastructure into the foundation for digital transformation and AI innovation, but organizations must now rethink strategy around resilience, sovereignty, and trust rather than merely scale and efficiency.

Key findings: 82% are refining their cloud approach due to geopolitical and regulatory change, 94% plan to adjust and expand cloud architecture, 86% view agentic AI capabilities as decisive for cloud provider selection, yet only 29% are actually scaling agentic AI, and only 10% have fully integrated advanced FinOps practices.

The survey highlights three themes: sovereignty and trust (multi-cloud with sovereign and national clouds becoming standard, data localization as primary trust concern), agentic AI (already influencing provider selection despite low scaling adoption, transforming cloud from infrastructure to autonomous intelligence platform), and cost governance (FinOps framework emerging as standard but maturity remains low).

Organizations are advised to position cloud as a strategic platform, embed FinOps and governance, integrate AI responsibly, and strengthen sovereignty and trust mechanisms.
