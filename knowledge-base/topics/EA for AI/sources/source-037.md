## Summary

Bain argues that agentic AI represents a fundamental shift in enterprise technology architecture. Unlike previous automation waves addressing discrete steps, AI agents can reason, coordinate, and execute complex multistep workflows requiring human judgment. The report identifies a two-tier orchestration architecture: higher-level orchestrator agents manage workflows while task agents execute individual steps.

Seven architectural imperatives: (1) Modernize core platforms — convert batch-based systems to API-accessible, real-time architectures; (2) Ensure interoperability — adopt standards like Model Context Protocol (MCP) to break silos; (3) Distribute accountability — central platform teams manage infrastructure while business domains handle assembly and monitoring; (4) Scale data access — build ingestion pipelines for unstructured sources; (5) Update governance and controls — real-time explainability, behavioral observability, adaptive security; (6) Shift the engineering paradigm — evolve DevOps for agent lifecycles; (7) Reimagine the agent experience — position agents as primary interaction channels.

Investment framework: 5-10% of technology spending in the near term (3-5 years) toward foundational capabilities; long-term up to 50% could support enterprise-wide agents, though efficiency gains offset costs. Four implementation motions: focus on select domains for early value, evaluate architectural readiness, embed governance from inception, and deploy agents in the transformation itself.

## Key Takeaways

- Two-tier orchestration: orchestrator agents manage workflows, task agents execute steps
- Seven architectural imperatives spanning platforms, interoperability (MCP), accountability, data, governance, engineering, and agent experience
- 5-10% of tech spending should go to AI foundations in next 3-5 years; up to 50% long-term
- Agents themselves will handle development, testing, and operations, freeing engineers for strategy
- Case study: South American bank's WhatsApp-based conversational agent for autonomous payments
