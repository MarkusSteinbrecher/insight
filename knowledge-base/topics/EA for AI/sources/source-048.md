## Summary

KPMG addresses the gap between AI ambition and infrastructure readiness, finding that only 14% of companies are fully prepared for AI adoption. While 95% acknowledge AI will increase infrastructure demands, only 17% have networks capable of handling them. The article identifies five critical infrastructure areas: network bandwidth, compute and memory optimization, security and compliance, on-premise vs. cloud strategy, and edge computing for reduced latency.

A two-phase methodology is presented: Phase 1 (Gather and Analyze) covers current-state assessment, stakeholder interviews, capability evaluation, and market research; Phase 2 (Envision the Future) covers future-state design, roadmap development, architecture diagrams, and investment strategies.

Key statistics paint a concerning readiness picture: 23% report limited or absent scalability in current IT frameworks, 30% experience network latency and throughput issues, 54% describe infrastructure as having only moderate or limited scalability, and only 31% claim highly scalable infrastructure. Despite this, 92% of companies plan to increase AI investment over three years, and 93% of enterprise IT leaders are implementing or planning AI agents within two years.

The AI market is projected to grow 25-fold from $189 billion (2023) to $4.8 trillion by 2033.
