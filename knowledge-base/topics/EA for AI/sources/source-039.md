## Summary

Bain assesses the current state of agentic AI adoption, finding that advanced enterprises capture 10-25% EBITDA improvements by scaling AI across essential business processes, while most organizations remain in experimental stages with minimal gains.

A four-level agentic AI development framework: Level 1 (LLM-driven information retrieval), Level 2 (single-task autonomous workflows), Level 3 (cross-system orchestration with supervised workflows), Level 4 (multi-agent collaborative constellations — theoretical). Current deployment is focused on Levels 2-3.

The report takes a notably pragmatic stance on architectural reality vs. theory, identifying challenges: operational complexity spanning multiple systems with informal processes, absence of universal communication standards (MCP lacks USB-equivalent standardization), compounding errors in multistep processes, unclean data, and privacy/security concerns. The authors compare envisioned interconnected agent architectures to Web 3.0 aspirations — "logically sound but unlikely to survive contact with actual enterprise realities intact." Vendor competition creates "walled gardens" complicating integration.

Three priority actions: (1) Maintain momentum on process redesign and data standardization; (2) Follow proven playbooks with five success factors — top-down goals, GM accountability (not IT), complete workflow redesign, targeted data cleanup, and selective build/buy/partner strategies; (3) Balanced architectural philosophy — expect domain-specific platforms, not monolithic enterprise systems; implement human-in-the-loop oversight ("Iron Man suits, not fully autonomous robots").

## Key Takeaways

- AI leaders capturing 10-25% EBITDA improvements; most organizations still experimental
- Four-level maturity framework: information retrieval → single-task → cross-system → multi-agent (theoretical)
- Pragmatic counterpoint: interconnected agent architectures compared to Web 3.0 — "unlikely to survive enterprise realities"
- MCP lacks USB-equivalent standardization; vendor walled gardens complicate integration
- Process redesign and data cleanup are the most important aspects — waiting for tech stabilization is ineffective
- "Iron Man suits, not fully autonomous robots" — human-in-the-loop is essential

## Notable Quotes

- "The most important aspects of the transformation are process redesign and cleaning up the data and application environment."
