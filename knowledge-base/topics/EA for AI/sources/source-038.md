## Summary

Bain addresses the challenge of scaling generative AI beyond pilot phases, arguing that organizations cannot scale AI without fundamentally reshaping their technology function across five critical areas.

(1) Re-architecting the tech stack — three layers requiring change: operational systems (content generation, knowledge management, reporting), integration and orchestration systems (agentic AI may eventually replace existing workflow systems), and data analytics/ML systems (unstructured data processing, AIaaS platforms, MLOps). Data platforms need shared catalogues, version control, and lineage tracking. (2) Upgrading operational workflows — federated AI development models with clearly defined roles for teams producing and consuming AI services; AI-first software development processes for rapid iteration. (3) Upskilling engineering teams — new capabilities for integrating, testing, and scaling AI to production grade. (4) Redefining technology spending mix — budget reallocation to support AI investments while capturing AI-driven efficiencies. (5) Reviewing risk management and governance — updated frameworks for deployment, monitoring, and lifecycle management.

A critical foundation is MLOps discipline — treating AI models with the same rigor as software code. The strategic recommendation is to pursue "no-regret moves now while maintaining flexibility to adapt."

## Key Takeaways
