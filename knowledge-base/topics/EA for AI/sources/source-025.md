- The organization is leveraging existing professional practices for those architecting and training AI models

## Summary
The Open Group, the standards body behind TOGAF and ArchiMate, has launched multiple AI-related initiatives that signal how the enterprise architecture standards landscape is evolving to accommodate artificial intelligence. Central to these efforts is the positioning of The Open Group as a "trusted facilitator" for professional practice standards in the context of AI-powered technologies.

A flagship product of these initiatives is The Open Group Eagle AI Assistant, which uses large language model technology combined with Open Group standards to provide real-time, authoritative guidance for enterprise architects. The tool features citation tracking to ensure traceability to official sources, multilingual support for global accessibility, and persona-based interactions tailored for different user roles (enterprise architects, trainers, organizational leaders). This represents an interesting case of "eating your own cooking" -- using AI to help practitioners apply architecture standards more effectively.

At the February 2026 Enterprise Architecture Practitioners Conference in London, workshops focused specifically on making autonomous AI systems reliable business tools. TOGAF 10 continues to evolve through annually released Series Guides, though the core ADM framework has not yet been fundamentally restructured for AI-native organizations. The Open Group is also developing the Open Agile Architecture Standard, which may prove more naturally aligned with AI's rapid iteration cycles.

## Notable Quotes
> "The Open Group intends to be a trusted facilitator for the future of professional practice standards in the context of AI-powered technologies."

> "Powered by advanced artificial intelligence, The Open Group Eagle AI Assistant delivers instant, authoritative guidance across The Open Group Standards, helping architects work faster, think deeper, and apply standards with confidence."

## Relevance to Topic
This source tracks how the most influential EA standards body is responding to AI. The Open Group's AI initiatives reveal both progress and gaps: while they are developing AI-powered tools for architects and hosting workshops on AI in the enterprise, the fundamental TOGAF ADM has not yet been restructured for AI-native development. The Eagle AI Assistant represents an innovative use of AI within EA practice itself. The evolution of TOGAF 10 through Series Guides suggests an incremental adaptation approach rather than a radical framework redesign, which contrasts with the more aggressive adaptation strategies recommended by other sources.
