## Summary

Based on a global survey of 1,500+ leaders across 15 countries, launched ahead of Davos 2026. Organizations across industries view AI as a core lever for long-term growth, and more than half commit to sustained investment over a five-year horizon.

Key findings: AI budgets rising from 3% to 5% of annual business budgets (2025 to 2026). More than half of organizations prioritize AI investments in sales, marketing, and IT operations. 38% already operationalizing Gen AI use cases, with agentic AI and edge AI gaining traction.

Critical enablers for enterprise-wide deployment: strong executive sponsorship (67%), external partnerships (59%), governance and ethical frameworks (53%), and scalable data infrastructure (51%). 66% of organizations report measurable productivity and decision-quality improvements through human-AI collaboration. Six in ten are redefining skillsets and investing in workforce upskilling. Data and AI sovereignty are top concerns, with 54% prioritizing data control.

Recommendations: strengthen AI essentials to unlock enterprise-wide intelligence; advance AI readiness through governance and strategic guardrails; build human-AI chemistry as a core organizational capability; balance "transform now" and "build tomorrow" for efficiency today and reinvention for the future.
