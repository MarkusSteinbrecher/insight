## Key Takeaways

- Proposes a TOGAF-based enterprise architectural framework that utilizes AI across all significant EA domains
- Addresses the gap in providing comprehensive guidance for organizations pursuing AI-enabled digital transformation
- Expands TOGAF's traditional architectural domains to explicitly incorporate AI capabilities
- Establishes entry points and applicability domains where AI can enhance enterprise operations across technological and business layers
- Recommends further research into practical implementation and evaluation

## Summary

This IEEE conference paper from IC3INA 2023 presents a systematic approach to integrating artificial intelligence across all domains of the TOGAF enterprise architecture framework. The authors from Institut Teknologi Bandung argue that while organizations increasingly pursue AI-enabled digital transformation, there is a lack of comprehensive architectural guidance for doing so within established EA frameworks.

The proposed framework adapts TOGAF by expanding its traditional architectural domains — business, data, application, and technology — to explicitly incorporate AI capabilities at each layer. Rather than treating AI as a bolt-on technology, the framework establishes entry points and applicability domains where AI can enhance enterprise operations. The approach covers cloud computing, IoT, security, and ERP integration alongside AI.

The paper is foundational in that it's one of the first peer-reviewed academic works to systematically map AI capabilities onto TOGAF domains, providing a bridge between the "replace TOGAF" camp (source 1) and the "extend TOGAF" camp.

## Notable Quotes

> The framework aims to "guide organizations in leveraging AI for accelerated digital transformation" through TOGAF-aligned architectural domains.

## Relevance to Topic

A key academic reference for the "extend TOGAF for AI" approach, directly relevant to the debate in our existing sources between replacing legacy EA frameworks (source 1) vs. working within them (source 2). Provides peer-reviewed grounding for the TOGAF adaptation argument.
