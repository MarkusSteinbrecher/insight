## Summary

BCG examines how agentic AI is redefining enterprise platforms. Unlike earlier AI waves, agentic AI systems can observe, understand, plan, and execute tasks with minimal human intervention. The article reports that agentic AI drives 17% of total AI value today and is expected to nearly double by 2028, with 70% of AI's potential value concentrated in core business functions.

Key adoption data: 35% of companies have begun using agentic AI, another 44% plan to deploy soon, and 76% of executives view agentic AI more as a coworker than a tool.

The article proposes a "freedom within a frame" shared AI platform with core components: data connectors, orchestration frameworks, model management, monitoring, tiered autonomy controls, and responsible AI controls. A three-tier autonomy framework progresses from Foundation (tool orchestration and transparency), to Workflow (automation through five patterns: Prompt Chaining, Routing, Parallelization, Evaluator-Optimizer, Orchestrator-Workers), to Autonomous (agents determine their own approaches dynamically).

Case studies include: a shipbuilding company reducing engineering resources by 45% and lead time by 80%; a global industrial goods company achieving 2 percentage-point EBITDA uplift; and a consumer goods company cutting cycle time by 60%. The article applies the "10/20/70 rule": algorithms account for 10% of AI transformation work, technology backbone 20%, and people and processes 70%.

## Key Takeaways

- Agentic AI drives 17% of total AI value today, expected to nearly double by 2028
- 35% of companies already using agentic AI; 76% of executives view it as a coworker
- Shared AI platform design: "freedom within a frame" — centralized infrastructure, decentralized innovation
- Three-tier autonomy framework: Foundation → Workflow → Autonomous
- The 10/20/70 rule: 10% algorithms, 20% tech backbone, 70% people and processes
- MCP described as "USB-C port for AI agents" — standardized connection reducing integration complexity

## Notable Quotes

- "Concentrate approximately 80% of efforts on end-to-end workflow redesign and new offerings, with only 20% on broad AI deployment."
