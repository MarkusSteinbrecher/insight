## Key Takeaways
- Three trends define the EA landscape in 2025: ongoing recessionary fears, geopolitical threats, and disruptive AI capabilities
- More than 80% of CEOs expect AI to contribute to top-line growth in 2025, but only 3% of CIOs expect the same — CIOs anticipate AI's primary value from productivity gains, revealing a critical expectation gap
- EA leaders must develop a new EA operating model for federated business designs, reduce technical debt through composable architectures, and expand team skills to include financial modeling and AI competencies
- The emergence of AI in EA demands the creation of a dedicated AI Architect role
- By 2028, half of EA teams are expected to rebrand themselves, emphasizing their strategic role as business partners who achieve business goals
- EA has evolved from traditional methods to a business-outcome-driven approach and is now moving toward acting as an internal management consultancy
- EA teams must architect the future with AI reference models and value stream mapping, while orchestrating modernization through AI governance, platform engineering, and composite applications
- Gartner predicts 40% of enterprise applications will integrate task-specific AI agents by end of 2026, up from less than 5% in 2025

## Summary
Gartner identifies three macro trends reshaping enterprise architecture strategy in 2025, with AI capabilities being the most disruptive force alongside economic uncertainty and geopolitical risk. A striking finding is the expectation gap between CEOs and CIOs on AI's value: over 80% of CEOs see AI driving top-line growth, while only 3% of CIOs agree — with technology leaders focused on productivity gains instead. This disconnect creates a strategic challenge that EA must help bridge.

Gartner prescribes three imperatives for EA leaders. First, develop a new EA operating model suited to federated business designs — organizations where decision-making is distributed rather than centralized. Second, modernize and rationalize technology portfolios by reducing technical debt and embracing composable architectures that enable flexibility and reuse. Third, expand EA team skills beyond traditional technology and process competencies to include financial modeling, analysis, and AI capabilities such as data-driven architectures, data modeling, and AI solution development.

A significant call-to-action is the creation of a dedicated AI Architect role — Gartner sees this as a demand-driven necessity, not a nice-to-have. The broader vision is that EA teams must evolve from technical custodians to strategic business partners, with half expected to rebrand accordingly by 2028. Gartner's prediction that 40% of enterprise apps will integrate task-specific AI agents by end of 2026 underscores the urgency of these architectural transformations.

> "Heads of enterprise architecture must guide tech investments, evolve models for innovation, and embrace AI for future-ready architecture."

## Relevance to Topic
Gartner's analysis is highly relevant as it frames EA for AI within the broader strategic context of economic and geopolitical uncertainty. The CEO-CIO expectation gap on AI value is a crucial insight for EA practitioners trying to bridge business strategy and technology implementation. The three imperatives (new operating model, composable architectures, expanded skills) provide a practical roadmap for EA transformation. The call for a dedicated AI Architect role validates the hypothesis that AI requires new specialized architectural expertise, and the prediction on AI agent adoption provides a concrete timeline for architectural readiness.
