## Key Takeaways
- Enterprise architecture is defined as "the holistic design of people, processes, and technology to execute digitally inspired strategic goals"
- Three principles for organizational redesign through EA: (1) break key outcomes into components with designated accountability, (2) empower cross-functional teams, (3) allow business design to influence strategy
- Componentization — decomposing a business into reusable people-process-technology bundles — is the foundation of modern EA
- Each component becomes a "living asset" with a team that continually improves processes and technologies in response to changing needs
- Strategy becomes both top-down and bottom-up: leaders create teams to seize opportunities while component teams reformulate strategy based on continuous learning
- CarMax example: evolved from 3 initial product teams (~2015) to 30+ empowered teams with accountability for specified components of an omnichannel business model
- Traditional management separates IT (systems), functional leaders (processes), and business managers (people) — EA integrates these into unified component teams
- When companies fund teams rather than strategic initiatives or systems development projects, they can respond almost instantaneously to emerging opportunities

## Summary
MIT Sloan Management Review authors Jeanne Ross and Cynthia Beath make the case that enterprise architecture is essential for any organization seeking to compete in the digital economy. They define EA broadly as the holistic design of people, processes, and technology — not just IT systems — to execute digitally inspired strategic goals. Every negative customer interaction via app, website, phone, or service provider "exposes your architectural inadequacies."

The article establishes three core principles for EA-driven organizational redesign. First, componentization: breaking key business outcomes (products, customer experiences, core processes) into reusable components with clear accountability, where each component is a living asset continuously improved by a dedicated team. Second, empowerment: cross-functional teams (product owners, developers, user designers, data scientists, legal, finance) are given autonomy to define and meet their goals. Third, strategy influence: as component teams address strategic objectives, they simultaneously reformulate strategy based on continuous learning about customer needs and technology capabilities.

The CarMax case study illustrates the evolutionary approach: starting with three product teams in 2015 to address urgent online experience needs, then gradually expanding to 30+ empowered teams covering the full omnichannel business model. This demonstrates that EA transformation is incremental and value-generating at each step, not a big-bang redesign.

## Relevance to Topic
While this article predates the current AI wave (published August 2020), it provides essential foundational context for the EA for AI topic. The definition of EA as encompassing people, processes, and technology — not just IT systems — is particularly relevant as AI transforms all three dimensions simultaneously. The componentization principle directly maps to the modular, composable architectures that AI implementations require. The cross-functional team model anticipates the human-AI collaboration patterns emerging in AI-native organizations. Understanding these EA fundamentals is necessary to appreciate how profoundly AI is reshaping the discipline.
