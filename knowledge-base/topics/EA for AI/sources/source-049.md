## Summary

PwC's survey of 1,030 US executives (308 business, 722 technology roles; companies with $500M+ revenue) identifies organizations transitioning toward "AI-first, cloud-powered" operating models. The survey defines "Top Performers" (12% of respondents) who are 2x more likely to realize measurable value from cloud and AI investments.

Top Performers distinguish themselves across four strategic dimensions: AI-powered cloud architectures (67% have formalized AI strategy vs. 37% of others), data modernization (72% achieved all-in cloud adoption for data vs. 33%), IT function evolution (65% achieved holistic AI adoption in IT), and cloud service provider relationships (strategic vendor management aligned with AI economics).

Key findings include: 41% achieved improved customer experience through GenAI, 40% realized productivity gains, 92% of Top Performers expect increased cloud budgets, and 98% of Top Performers report adequate data architecture/governance for GenAI. GenAI is the primary cloud budget driver for 63% of Top Performers.

The survey identifies a shift from viewing AI as a technology tool to recognizing it as an essential business component, with CEO-level consideration of technology architecture choices becoming standard among high performers.
