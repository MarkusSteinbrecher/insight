## Summary

BCG Platinion documents the 25-year evolution of enterprise architecture from rigid, static systems toward adaptive, autonomous frameworks. The article covers current patterns, emerging technologies, and the evolving architect role.

Current architectural patterns: self-healing and event-driven architectures gaining widespread adoption; AI-enabled predictive maintenance becoming standard; microservices being reconsidered with modular monoliths experiencing a resurgence to address over-complexity. Self-healing systems — with detection, diagnosis, and predictive repair — are positioned as the emerging standard, with potential efficiency gains of 50-60% through predictive maintenance.

On emerging technologies: AI requires transparency, human-in-the-loop mechanisms, and MLOps discipline; blockchain remains limited to niche applications; quantum computing is positioned for broader transformative implications and expected to amplify AI capabilities significantly.

The architect role is shifting from gatekeepers enforcing rigid standards to collaborative technology advisors designing modular systems in real-time. Five priority focus areas: AI system leadership (data pipelines and model operations), business translation (vision into composable architectures), technology piloting, team coaching, and organizational literacy (embedding architectural decision-making across business units). GenAI tooling increasingly blurs the distinction between Enterprise and Solution Architecture.

Architectural imperatives: data-centric design, cloud-native deployment, increasing autonomy, and modular construction. AIOps manages infrastructure and anomaly detection. Green IT identified as a significant opportunity.

## Key Takeaways

- EA has evolved from backroom function to boardroom strategic priority over 25 years
- Self-healing systems with predictive repair are the emerging architectural standard (50-60% efficiency gains)
- Microservices being reconsidered; modular monoliths resurgent as alternative
- AI can increase development efficiency by up to 50%
- Architect role shifting from gatekeeper to collaborative advisor; GenAI blurs EA vs. Solution Architecture
- Five architect priorities: AI system leadership, business translation, technology piloting, team coaching, organizational literacy
