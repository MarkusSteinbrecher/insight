## Summary

BCG proposes "Enterprise as Code" (EaC) — the practice of explicitly capturing an organization's implicit operating model (processes, decision-making logic, governance rules, workflows) and expressing them as code readable and executable by both people and AI systems. The article argues organizations must shift from intuition-based operations to specification-based ones as a prerequisite for deriving value from AI.

The current EaC paradigm differs from historical BPM/DevOps approaches through three breakthroughs: programmable infrastructure at all organizational levels (not just IT), human-AI convergence via autonomous agents that interpret and act on business logic, and dynamic orchestration of processes based on contextual events and real-time data. Processes become "living artifacts" continuously tested, verified, monitored, and adapted.

AI agents operate on the basis of knowledge, so organizations must explicitly define best practices for each process — removing unnecessary steps, redefining roles, consolidating tasks, and ensuring logic is sound before automating. Much of AI's value depends on how clearly an organization defines its desired outcomes.

Practical starting points: identify high-volume, high-value processes; capture operating logic clearly; build governance and controls into logic from the start; design work for continuous measurement and improvement. Competitive advantage depends on how precisely an organization can describe itself to the systems running its processes.

## Key Takeaways

- "Enterprise as Code" captures implicit operating models as code executable by people and AI agents
- Three breakthroughs distinguish EaC from earlier BPM: programmable infrastructure, human-AI convergence, dynamic orchestration
- Processes become living artifacts — continuously tested, monitored, and adapted
- Organizations must define best practices explicitly before AI agents can operate on them
- Clarity acts as an accelerant: the more precisely work is defined, the faster it can evolve
- Just as cloud democratized infrastructure, EaC will democratize organizational capability
