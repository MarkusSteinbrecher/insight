## Summary

This PwC executive playbook provides a broad overview of agentic AI as an evolution beyond traditional GenAI, focused on process automation and business transformation. The report covers the definition and key characteristics of agentic AI (autonomy, goal-oriented behaviour, environment interaction, learning capability, workflow optimisation, multi-agent communication), traces the evolution from rule-based systems through multimodal agents to current autonomous systems, and argues that the central question for organisations is not whether to adopt but how quickly.

The playbook presents the "service-as-a-software" model as a paradigm shift — where organisations pay for AI-delivered outcomes rather than traditional software licences. It profiles a copilot-to-autopilot transition path and discusses outsourcing through AI services with outcome-based pricing.

A significant portion of the report consists of real-world case studies across 15 industries and business functions (manufacturing/Siemens, healthcare/Mayo Clinic, finance/JPMorgan, retail/Amazon, logistics/DHL, energy/BP, education/Pearson, media/Netflix, telecom/AT&T, government/Singapore, HR/Unilever, customer service/Bank of America, marketing/Coca-Cola, supply chain/Walmart, R&D/Insilico Medicine, legal/Hogan Lovells, procurement/Coupa, IT operations/Microsoft, sales/Salesforce). Each case study includes technology stack, financial impact metrics, and non-financial benefits.

The report also covers agentic AI tooling (LangGraph, AutoGen, CrewAI, AutoGPT), a 6-step AI strategy roadmap (vision alignment, assess capabilities, meticulous execution, scale up, risk management, organisational change), and top 10 do's and don'ts for maximising ROI from AI investments.

## Key Takeaways

1. Agentic AI represents a shift from assisted intelligence (copilots) to autonomous process execution, with organisations expected to transition from copilot to autopilot models as AI systems demonstrate reliability.

2. The "service-as-a-software" model transforms AI economics: instead of paying for software licences or cloud subscriptions, organisations pay for specific outcomes delivered by AI agents, aligning costs directly with results.

3. Across 15+ industry case studies, financial impacts consistently show 15-35% improvements in cost reduction, efficiency gains, or revenue growth, though these figures are reported without methodology details.

4. The agentic AI tools ecosystem splits between commercial solutions (LangGraph, CrewAI) optimised for enterprise integration and open-source alternatives (AutoGen, AutoGPT) suited for prototyping and experimentation.

5. PwC's 6-step AI strategy roadmap emphasises starting with high-impact use cases, securing executive sponsorship, and iterating through pilot projects before scaling — a pattern consistent with standard enterprise technology adoption frameworks.

6. The report positions early adoption as creating competitive moats through learning curve advantages, barriers to entry, and market share gains, while late movers face higher costs of entry and struggle to match early adopters' personalised services.

7. Human oversight remains essential: the report explicitly warns against neglecting human oversight, rushing implementation, and underestimating complexity, positioning human-in-the-loop as a transitional necessity.

## Notable Quotes

> "The central question isn't whether to adopt this technology, but how swiftly organisations can integrate it to stay ahead of the competition." (p. 2)

> "Rather than purchasing traditional software licences or subscribing to cloud-based software-as-a-service (SaaS), businesses can now pay for specific outcomes delivered by AI agents." (p. 7)

> "A common strategy is to initially deploy AI in a 'copilot' role alongside human workers. This human-in-the-loop approach helps organisations build trust in AI capabilities over time." (p. 7)

> "Avoid the GenAI hype trap — focus on pragmatic steps that deliver real value." (p. 17)

## Methodology / Framework

The report does not describe a formal research methodology. It is a PwC executive playbook combining:
- Market sizing from PwC CEO surveys and industry estimates
- Case studies assembled from public company disclosures and PwC client engagements (no attribution methodology stated)
- A prescriptive 6-step AI strategy roadmap: (1) Vision alignment, (2) Assess capabilities, (3) Meticulous execution, (4) Scale up, (5) Risk management, (6) Organisational change
- Top 10 do's and don'ts distilled from PwC advisory experience

The case study financial metrics are presented without confidence intervals, sample sizes, or attribution methodology, making independent verification difficult.

## Connections

- Relates to: Enterprise AI adoption strategy, process automation, agentic AI architecture, multi-agent systems, AI governance, service model transformation
- Supports: The broad consensus that agentic AI extends beyond traditional GenAI capabilities and requires process redesign, not just automation of existing workflows
- Complements: Source-001 (enterprise AI architecture foundations), source-003 (enterprise AI implementation), source-004 through source-030 (various perspectives on EA for AI)
- Limitations: Primarily a GCC/Middle East regional focus; case study metrics lack methodological transparency; prescriptive rather than analytical in tone
