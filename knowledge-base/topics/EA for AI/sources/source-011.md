## Key Takeaways

- Proposes NAEF: a framework integrating three established methodologies — TOGAF, BADIR, and INSIGHT — for enterprise AI architecture
- TOGAF provides structured architectural design; BADIR guides business question translation into data-driven decisions; INSIGHT manages insights analysis
- Focus on translating business objectives into actionable insights through a structured data-to-decisions pipeline
- Addresses challenges in designing, implementing, and managing AI within organizational contexts
- Includes considerations for legacy system integration and AI governance

## Summary

This IEEE conference paper from ICICyTA 2024 proposes the Novel Enterprise Artificial Intelligence Architecture Framework (NAEF), which integrates three established frameworks to create a comprehensive methodology for enterprise AI systems. The integration of TOGAF (for architectural design), BADIR (for translating business questions into data-driven decisions), and INSIGHT (for insights analysis from business processes) represents a multi-methodology approach to enterprise AI architecture.

The framework is structured around translating business capabilities into decisions and insights through data architecture, application architecture, and technology architecture layers. It incorporates user feedback and iterative refinement, promoting stakeholder engagement through data-driven decision-making. The paper also includes simulated approaches, sample cases, and considerations for legacy system integration.

The paper's contribution is in demonstrating that enterprise AI architecture need not rely on a single framework but can synthesize multiple established methodologies. This multi-framework integration approach is a practical alternative to building entirely new frameworks from scratch.

## Notable Quotes

> The framework emphasizes "integration of three frameworks — TOGAF, BADIR, and INSIGHT — to create a robust and comprehensive methodology" for enterprise AI.

## Relevance to Topic

Demonstrates a practical multi-framework integration approach to enterprise AI architecture. The TOGAF+BADIR+INSIGHT synthesis is a novel contribution that addresses the business-to-technology alignment gap identified in other sources.
