## Key Takeaways
- 78% of tech leaders anticipate broad, targeted, or transformational integration of AI agents into architecture workflows over the next five years (Deloitte 2025 Horizon Architecture Survey)
- AI is reengineering how technology teams are structured, governed, and led — not just changing tools and headcount
- 66% of surveyed organizations are piloting or exploring AI-enhanced enterprise architecture
- The number of AI architect roles is expected to nearly double, from 30% today to 58% in the next two years
- AI budgets are expected to rise from 8% to 13% of tech budgets on average over the next two years
- 71% of organizations are currently modernizing core infrastructure to support AI implementation
- Enterprise architecture must be redesigned for modularity and observability — the ability to see, understand, and optimize a system by analyzing its external outputs
- CIOs reporting directly to CEOs has risen from 41% (2015) to 65% (2025), signaling technology's central role in strategy

## Summary
Deloitte's Tech Trends 2026 report argues that AI is not incrementally enhancing the technology organization but fundamentally rebuilding it. The research draws on multiple Deloitte surveys (Tech Spending Outlook, Horizon Architecture Survey, Tech Executive Survey) to document how AI is reshaping tech organization priorities, people, and purpose. CIOs now identify harnessing AI, data, and analytics as their primary focus, and 66% of large enterprises view their tech org as a revenue generator rather than a service center.

The article identifies specific architectural imperatives: new architectures must be designed for modularity and observability. It cites Western Digital's development of an observability architecture for holistic tech landscape management, and Coca-Cola's modular architecture with guiding core principles that can be localized globally. The piece highlights new roles emerging, including Human-AI collaboration designers and Edge AI/embedded systems engineers, alongside the near-doubling of AI architect positions.

A key finding is the tension between ambition and readiness: while organizations are moving rapidly on AI investment, most acknowledge they are still in exploratory phases of generative and agentic AI. The report argues that modernization must start with business problems rather than technology for its own sake, citing Broadcom's CIO on the importance of focusing on specific business problems before investing in AI.

## Notable Quotes
> "Agents and people will soon be completely integrated in terms of how work gets done, and it's going to happen really fast — faster than most companies are ready for. Companies need to get better at constant road mapping and iteration because the era of 'build it once and forget it' is over." — Tracey Franklin, Chief People and Digital Technology Officer, Moderna

> "Modernization is not about technology for technology's sake; it's about addressing fundamental business problems like costs, go-to-market issues, and so on." — Alan Davidson, CIO, Broadcom

> "For global organizations, one size rarely fits all. Our approach has been to build a modular architecture and a set of guiding core principles supported by an agile team able to operate at speed while localizing as needed." — Neeraj Tolmare, SVP and CIO, The Coca-Cola Company

## Relevance to Topic
This report is highly relevant as it documents the current state of enterprise architecture transformation driven by AI, with extensive survey data quantifying the shift. It connects EA directly to organizational design, arguing that architecture is no longer just a technical discipline but one that shapes how entire organizations are structured and governed. The modularity and observability imperatives provide concrete architectural principles for the EA for AI topic, and the survey data on AI architect role growth directly supports the case for a new EA paradigm.
