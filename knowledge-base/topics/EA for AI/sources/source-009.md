## Key Takeaways

- Seven major EA trends for 2025-2026: AI-driven EA, cloud-native architectures, sustainability-driven architectures, human-centric design, strategic agile roadmaps, resilience and security, data-driven decision-making
- AI enables automated insights and scenario planning, making it crucial for aligning architectures with strategic goals
- Sustainability is positioned as a "business need" not a "nice-to-have" in EA strategy
- Enterprise systems must prioritize user experience to maximize adoption, productivity, and satisfaction
- Data governance ensuring accuracy, security, and compliance is the "cornerstone of effective decision-making"

## Summary

This article from BOC Group identifies seven key trends shaping enterprise architecture in 2025-2026. While AI-driven EA is the first trend discussed, the article takes a broader view of EA evolution, positioning AI alongside sustainability, cloud-native architecture, human-centric design, strategic planning, resilience, and data governance.

The AI coverage is relatively high-level compared to the more specialized sources, but the article is valuable for its holistic perspective — it places AI-driven EA within the context of other forces reshaping the discipline. The sustainability angle is particularly notable as a dimension absent from most other sources on EA for AI. The article emphasizes that architectural strategies should incorporate sustainability analysis, carbon footprint reduction, and eco-friendly design principles alongside AI integration.

The article recommends adopting cloud-native platforms for modeling environments, implementing data governance frameworks, building adaptive roadmaps with continuous feedback loops, and integrating robustness and reliability into systems from inception.

## Notable Quotes

> "Sustainability is no longer a 'nice-to-have' — it's a business need."

> "Data is the cornerstone of effective decision-making."

## Relevance to Topic

Provides a broader EA trends context that complements the AI-specific focus of other sources. The sustainability dimension is a unique perspective absent from the academic and practitioner sources, and may represent an important angle for thought leadership content.
