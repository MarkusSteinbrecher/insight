## Summary

EY announces a suite of solutions called "EY.ai Value Blueprints" designed to help organizations transform into AI-native enterprises. The core philosophy is ground-up redesign rather than incremental AI bolt-on. Research shows 87% of senior leaders report significant barriers to agentic AI adoption.

The framework is structured around seven essential tiers forming interconnected layers of an AI-native organization: (1) Customer experience design, (2) Workforce collaboration models, (3) Process reimagining, (4) Trust and security controls, (5) Intelligence systems, (6) Agentic platform infrastructure, (7) Systems of record architecture.

A healthcare case study demonstrates the Order-to-Cash blueprint: reduced manual work, enhanced customer self-service, improved engagement, stronger revenue protection, and freed employees for higher-value activities. The article positions this as a competitive necessity — organizations choosing incremental adoption risk being "outmaneuvered by competitors who rebuild from the foundation."
