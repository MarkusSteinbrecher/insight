## Insight

All three sources independently converge on the idea that multi-agent AI systems represent a fundamental shift in how enterprise architecture is conceived, built, and operated. This is not a minor variation on existing automation -- it is positioned as a paradigm change. Source 1 (Kumar) proposes an entire composable layered framework built around autonomous agents communicating via A2A protocols. Source 2 (Oaj et al.) demonstrates a concrete multi-agent system (using AutoGen 0.2) that automates business architecture artefact generation through specialized, collaborating agents. Source 3 (Economist Impact) documents enterprise-wide recognition that AI is transforming architecture requirements, with 97% of enterprise architects predicting natural language interaction with complex datasets within three years.

The convergence is notable because it spans different levels of abstraction: a theoretical architecture framework (Source 1), a working prototype for a specific EA activity (Source 2), and a large-scale empirical survey of enterprise readiness (Source 3). Each independently frames the shift as moving from static, manual, or centralized approaches to dynamic, agent-driven, and distributed ones. The language differs -- "decentralized cognition" (Source 1), "agentic AI-enabled modelling" (Source 2), "AI's unlock moment" (Source 3) -- but the underlying thesis is consistent: enterprises need architectures where AI agents are first-class participants, not bolt-on tools.

This convergence across academic, industry-academic partnership, and large-scale survey research strengthens the signal that agentic EA is not a niche topic but an emerging mainstream concern. The fact that all three sources were published within 2024-2025 suggests this is a live, rapidly forming consensus.

## Evidence

- Source 1 proposes autonomous agents with A2A communication as the "core coordination mechanism" of enterprise architecture, arguing this represents a "structural redefinition" from centralized automation to decentralized cognition.
- Source 2 builds a working multi-agent system (five specialized agents) for automating business capability modelling, a core EA activity, demonstrating that agentic AI is already being applied to EA tasks.
- Source 3 reports 85% of organisations are actively using GenAI, with 73% citing it as critical to long-term strategy, and enterprise architects identifying fundamental architecture gaps (real-time processing, data pipelines, security) that imply current architectures were not designed for AI-native workloads.
- All three sources reference or assume event-driven, modular, composable architectures as the target state.

## Significance

This pattern establishes the central premise of the "EA for AI" topic: enterprise architecture itself must be reimagined for an AI-native world. The convergence from three very different source types (academic theory, prototype implementation, industry survey) provides a strong foundation for thought leadership that argues this shift is both theoretically grounded and empirically validated. It also suggests that EA practitioners who do not engage with agentic AI concepts risk working with rapidly obsolescing frameworks.

## Questions to Explore

- What are the specific capabilities an enterprise architecture team needs to develop to design and govern multi-agent systems?
- How do existing EA maturity models need to evolve to account for agentic AI capabilities?
- Is there a meaningful distinction between "AI for EA" (using AI to do architecture work) and "EA for AI" (designing architectures that support AI), and how do these interact?
- What organisational structures (beyond COEs) are emerging to manage agentic EA?
