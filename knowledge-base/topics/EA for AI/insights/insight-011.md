## Insight

Insight-002 identified a contested debate between replacing and extending TOGAF for AI-era enterprise architecture, based on contradictory positions in the original PDF sources. The web sources (006, 007, 010, 011, 012) decisively shift this balance: five out of nine web sources independently advocate extending, adapting, or augmenting TOGAF rather than replacing it, and none calls for outright replacement. This represents a significant signal that the practitioner and broader academic community is converging on pragmatic adaptation rather than wholesale framework abandonment.

The most concrete contribution comes from source-006 (Stender), which cites University of Melbourne research (Ern et al., 2025) proposing specific TOGAF modifications: embedding iterative feedback loops within the ADM cycle, expanding artifacts to include AI lifecycle components (GenAI catalogs, drift detection, explainability modules), integrating ethical governance and regulatory compliance, and developing interdisciplinary roles. Source-007 (Krause) demonstrates practical mapping of AI capabilities onto specific TOGAF ADM phases: automated process mining in Phases B-C, compliance monitoring in Phase G, and change management in Phase H, alongside Gartner's TIME model for categorising IT assets for AI integration. Source-010 (Fitriani et al., IEEE 2023) provides the earliest peer-reviewed academic framework for expanding TOGAF domains to explicitly incorporate AI capabilities across all layers. Source-011 (Ipung, IEEE 2024) takes a synthesis approach, integrating TOGAF with BADIR and INSIGHT frameworks rather than replacing any of them. Source-012 (Wairagade & Govindarajan, IEEE 2025) evaluates established EA patterns (SOA, EDA, Microservices) for AI integration, working within rather than against existing architectural traditions.

This convergence is notable because it emerges independently across very different source types: practitioner articles (sources 006, 007), peer-reviewed IEEE papers (sources 010, 011, 012), and across geographies (Europe, Indonesia, India). The consistency suggests that while Kumar's critique of TOGAF (source-001) identifies real limitations, the field's practical response is adaptation rather than revolution -- consistent with how EA frameworks have historically evolved (TOGAF 8 to 9 to 10, ITIL v3 to v4).

## Supporting Evidence

- University of Melbourne research proposes concrete TOGAF modifications: iterative ADM feedback loops, AI lifecycle artifacts, drift detection, explainability modules (source-006, citing Ern et al., 2025)
- AI mapped onto TOGAF ADM phases: process mining (B-C), compliance monitoring (G), change management (H) (source-007)
- Gartner TIME model (Tolerate/Invest/Migrate/Eliminate) applied as a complementary lens for AI integration within existing EA (source-007)
- TOGAF-based framework expanding all EA domains to incorporate AI capabilities (source-010, IEEE 2023)
- NAEF framework integrating TOGAF + BADIR + INSIGHT for enterprise AI architecture (source-011, IEEE 2024)
- SOA, EDA, and Microservices evaluated as EA patterns for Gen AI integration within established architectural traditions (source-012, IEEE 2025)
- Source-001 (Kumar, PDF) remains the sole source advocating outright replacement, positioning it as an outlier rather than the consensus view
- Five of nine web sources (56%) actively work within or extend TOGAF; zero advocate replacing it

## Evidence Assessment

The evidence for this trend is strong through sheer convergence: five independent sources from different continents, publication types, and professional backgrounds all arrive at the same conclusion -- extend, do not replace. The Melbourne research cited in source-006 provides the most specific adaptation proposals, though it is cited secondhand (via Stender's article) rather than directly reviewed. The IEEE papers (sources 010, 011, 012) provide peer-reviewed academic grounding, though they range from conceptual frameworks (source-010) to multi-framework synthesis (source-011) to pattern evaluation (source-012), none of which includes large-scale empirical validation of the proposed extensions. Source-007's ADM phase mapping is practical but presented as the author's analysis rather than empirically tested. The absence of any web source advocating replacement is itself evidence, but it may reflect a bias in practitioner literature toward working within established structures (TOGAF certification represents significant professional investment). Kumar's replacement argument (source-001) may still prove correct if TOGAF's ADM proves fundamentally incompatible with agentic AI's continuous adaptation requirements, but the current weight of evidence favours adaptation.

## Implications

Enterprise architects can proceed with confidence that extending TOGAF for AI is the mainstream professional trajectory, not a defensive rear-guard action. Specific extension opportunities are now well-documented: AI lifecycle artifacts in the ADM, drift detection and explainability modules, iterative feedback loops replacing linear ADM cycles, and explicit AI governance phases. The Open Group (TOGAF's custodian) should take note of this convergence -- a formal "TOGAF for AI" extension or companion guide would meet a clear market demand. For thought leadership content, the nuanced position -- acknowledging Kumar's critique as directionally valid while advocating practical TOGAF adaptation as the realistic path -- represents a more credible stance than either extreme. Organisations should not wait for a formal framework update but should begin augmenting their TOGAF-based EA practices with AI-specific governance, artifact types, and ADM cycle modifications as documented across these sources.
