## Insight

The web sources reveal three significant dimensions of enterprise AI architecture that are almost entirely absent from the technical frameworks proposed in the academic literature (sources 001, 002, 010, 011, 012): sustainability and environmental impact, workforce transformation and role evolution, and organizational change management. These gaps are visible only when comparing the broader web practitioner sources against the narrower focus of the academic papers, making them a distinctive contribution of the web research phase.

Sustainability is the most striking absence. Source-009 (Galanski) positions sustainability-driven architecture as one of seven major EA trends for 2025-2026, arguing it is "a business need, not a nice-to-have." Yet not a single other source in the dataset -- neither the academic papers nor the practitioner articles focused on AI architecture -- addresses the environmental footprint of enterprise AI systems. The computational costs of training and running AI models, the energy consumption of multi-agent systems operating continuously, and the carbon implications of the massive data infrastructure required for enterprise AI are completely absent from every proposed framework. Given that enterprise AI architectures are designed to scale, this omission means organizations could be building architectures that are technically sound but environmentally unsustainable -- and potentially non-compliant with emerging ESG reporting requirements.

Workforce transformation receives slightly more attention but remains inadequately addressed at the architectural level. Source-006 (Stender) argues that Enterprise Architects should become "change enablers, not gatekeepers" and calls for interdisciplinary roles combining AI literacy with strategic architecture expertise. Source-007 (Krause) proposes the AI+HI=ECI (Elevated Collaborative Intelligence) model as a framework for human-AI collaboration. Source-005 (Salesforce) describes an "Agentic Enterprise" that integrates "digital AI workers with human employees." But none of these sources -- nor any of the academic frameworks -- provides architectural patterns for how enterprise systems should be designed to support the transition of human roles as AI agents take on increasing responsibilities. The EA frameworks describe technical layers and governance processes but not the organizational structures and human capability architectures needed to operate in an agent-augmented enterprise.

Source-003 (Economist Impact) provides indirect evidence for why these gaps matter: two-thirds of organizations are still experimenting with human-machine calibration, and 40% say their AI governance processes are insufficient. These are not primarily technical problems -- they are organizational and change management problems that the technically-focused EA frameworks are not equipped to address. Source-006's concept of EA systems as "continuously updated digital twins" hints at an approach that could integrate technical and organizational dimensions, but this idea remains undeveloped.

## Evidence

- Sustainability positioned as one of seven major EA trends: "no longer a nice-to-have -- it's a business need" (source-009) -- yet absent from every other source and every proposed framework
- Enterprise Architects should be "change enablers, not gatekeepers" with interdisciplinary skills combining AI literacy and strategic architecture (source-006)
- AI+HI=ECI (Elevated Collaborative Intelligence) model proposed for human-AI collaboration (source-007)
- "Agentic Enterprise" integrating digital AI workers with human employees (source-005) -- but no architectural patterns for workforce transition
- Two-thirds of organizations still experimenting with human-machine calibration (source-003)
- 40% say AI governance processes are insufficient (source-003) -- pointing to organizational, not just technical, gaps
- EA systems should function as "continuously updated digital twins" of enterprise operations (source-006)
- Human-centric design identified as an EA trend: systems should "prioritize user experience to maximize adoption, productivity, and satisfaction" (source-009)
- No academic framework (sources 001, 002, 010, 011, 012) addresses sustainability, workforce transition, or organizational change management as architectural concerns

## Significance

These missing dimensions represent a significant blind spot in the EA for AI discourse. Technical frameworks that ignore sustainability risk creating architectures that fail emerging regulatory and stakeholder expectations around ESG. Frameworks that ignore workforce transformation risk creating architectures that are technically deployable but organizationally unimplementable -- which may partly explain the 70-80% pilot failure rate documented in other insights. For thought leadership, this gap creates an opportunity to argue for a more holistic conception of enterprise AI architecture that encompasses not just technical layers and governance processes but also environmental sustainability, workforce capability planning, and organizational change architecture. A framework that integrates these dimensions would differentiate itself from the technically-focused proposals that dominate the current literature.

## Questions to Explore

- What is the energy and carbon footprint of a typical enterprise multi-agent AI architecture, and how does it compare to the systems it replaces?
- How should enterprise architects model the organizational and workforce implications of deploying AI agents at scale?
- What would a "change architecture" layer look like within an EA for AI framework -- one that explicitly addresses role evolution, skill development, and human-AI interaction design?
- Are sustainability considerations creating architectural constraints (e.g., preferences for smaller models, edge computing, efficient inference) that should be incorporated into EA design principles?
- How do leading organizations integrate sustainability metrics into their AI architecture decision-making?
- What can EA for AI learn from organizational change management frameworks (Kotter, ADKAR, Prosci) about designing architectures that are adoptable, not just deployable?
