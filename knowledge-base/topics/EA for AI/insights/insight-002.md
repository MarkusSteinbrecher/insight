## Insight

An emerging consensus is forming across academic research and industry practice that traditional enterprise architecture frameworks -- particularly TOGAF and ITIL -- are insufficient for designing and governing AI-native enterprise systems. This claim surfaces independently in all three sources, though from different angles and with varying degrees of directness. Kumar (source-001) makes the most explicit argument, stating that "legacy architecture methodologies such as TOGAF, ITIL, or siloed AI integration models fail to account for the continuous learning cycles, distributed agentic behaviors, and dynamic performance characteristics that define modern enterprise AI." The Oaj et al. paper (source-002) demonstrates the problem empirically: current Business Architecture methods produce "static artefacts that quickly become outdated in dynamic business environments," and proposes agentic AI as the means to make BA practices adaptive and continuous. The Economist Impact report (source-003) approaches the issue from a governance perspective, finding that Centres of Excellence are emerging as the practical governance mechanism because existing frameworks and organisational structures cannot coordinate AI adoption at enterprise scale.

The nature of the insufficiency differs across sources but converges on a common theme: traditional frameworks assume relatively stable, human-driven change cycles, while AI systems -- especially agentic ones -- require continuous adaptation, autonomous decision-making, and dynamic coordination. Kumar's framework proposes an entirely new composable architecture with agent-to-agent communication protocols that have no equivalent in TOGAF's Architecture Development Method. Oaj et al. show that even the practice of creating architecture artefacts is becoming automated, suggesting the frameworks need to evolve not just in what they describe but in how they are executed. The Economist report provides the market pressure behind this trend: 73% of respondents say GenAI is critical to long-term strategy, creating urgency that existing EA governance structures struggle to channel effectively.

This trend is still nascent. No established alternative framework has yet achieved the kind of broad adoption that TOGAF enjoys. What exists are proposals (Kumar's composable agentic architecture), prototypes (Oaj et al.'s ABMA system), and pragmatic workarounds (COEs as described in the Economist report). The trajectory, however, is clear: the EA discipline is under pressure to reinvent itself for the AI era.

## Supporting Evidence

- "Legacy architecture methodologies such as TOGAF, ITIL, or siloed AI integration models fail to account for the continuous learning cycles, distributed agentic behaviors, and dynamic performance characteristics that define modern enterprise AI." (source-001, p. 13)
- "Current methods in BA artefact generation and maintenance are largely manual, static, and time-consuming, which limits their effectiveness in dynamic and complex decision-making environments." (source-002, p. 1)
- COEs are emerging as governance enablers because existing organisational structures cannot coordinate AI adoption at enterprise scale (source-003)
- 40% of respondents say their organisation's AI safety and compliance processes are insufficient (source-003)
- 73% of respondents say GenAI is critical to their long-term strategic goals (source-003)
- "There is no such thing as a technology strategy. There's only a business strategy that technology supports." -- Melissa Pint, Frontier (source-003), suggesting that strategy-technology alignment -- a core EA concern -- is being reframed

## Evidence Assessment

This insight is assessed at **moderate confidence**. The claim that traditional frameworks are insufficient is well-argued across all three sources, but the evidence base has notable limitations. Kumar's paper (source-001) is a single-author academic proposal; while it makes a compelling theoretical case and provides comparative performance data for a specific security use case, it does not demonstrate that TOGAF or ITIL have been tried and failed at enterprise AI scale -- it argues from architectural principles that they will be insufficient. Oaj et al. (source-002) is a work-in-progress prototype that addresses a narrow slice of the problem (business capability modelling). The Economist Impact report (source-003) provides the strongest empirical evidence for the practical shortcomings of current governance, but it does not explicitly name TOGAF or ITIL as the problem.

The convergence across three independent sources, each approaching from different angles (theoretical architecture, practical BA tools, industry governance), strengthens the overall trend identification. However, the absence of direct empirical evidence -- such as case studies of TOGAF-based EA programs that failed specifically because of AI-related limitations -- keeps the confidence at medium rather than high. The EA community has historically adapted frameworks (TOGAF 10 included some digital updates), and the possibility that existing frameworks can be extended rather than replaced has not been thoroughly tested in the literature reviewed.

## Implications

Enterprise architects should prepare for a significant evolution of their core frameworks and methodologies. Rather than waiting for a single replacement framework to emerge, leaders should adopt a pragmatic approach: continue using TOGAF and ITIL as foundations for IT governance while developing supplementary practices for AI-specific concerns -- agentic system coordination, continuous learning governance, real-time performance management, and AI security. Centres of Excellence, as identified in source-003, represent one proven interim governance mechanism. The trend also suggests a career development imperative: enterprise architects who understand AI system design patterns, multi-agent architectures, and data engineering will be far better positioned than those who rely solely on traditional framework certifications. Framework bodies (The Open Group, AXELOS) should take note: the pressure for AI-native EA frameworks is building across both academia and industry.
