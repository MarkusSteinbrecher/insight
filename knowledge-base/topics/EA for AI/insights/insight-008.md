## Insight

The sources present contradictory positions on whether traditional enterprise architecture frameworks -- particularly TOGAF -- remain relevant in an AI-native world. Source 1 (Kumar) is unequivocal: "Legacy architecture methodologies such as TOGAF, ITIL, or siloed AI integration models fail to account for the continuous learning cycles, distributed agentic behaviors, and dynamic performance characteristics that define modern enterprise AI." The paper positions TOGAF as fundamentally insufficient and proposes a replacement framework built from first principles around agentic AI. Source 2 (Oaj et al.), by contrast, explicitly references TOGAF as the contextual foundation for business architecture and builds its ABMA system within the TOGAF conceptual universe -- the system generates TOGAF-compatible business architecture artefacts (capability models, value streams) and references the TOGAF Business Architecture domain as its operating context. Source 3 (Economist Impact) does not take an explicit position on TOGAF but documents a reality where enterprises are struggling with fundamental architecture modernisation, implying that current frameworks are not adequately guiding AI-era transformation.

This contradiction matters because TOGAF remains the most widely adopted EA framework globally, with hundreds of thousands of certified practitioners. If TOGAF is truly insufficient for AI-native enterprise architecture, this has massive implications for the EA profession, training, tooling, and governance. If it merely needs extension or augmentation (as Source 2 implicitly suggests), the transition path is very different. The tension between "replace" (Source 1) and "extend" (Source 2) reflects a broader debate in the EA community about whether AI represents a paradigm break or an evolutionary advance in enterprise design.

The middle ground may be that TOGAF's structural concepts (business, data, application, technology architecture domains) remain useful as an organising framework, but its processes, governance models, and assumptions about static artefacts need fundamental rethinking for dynamic, agent-driven environments. Neither source fully articulates this nuanced position.

## Evidence

- Source 1: Explicitly states TOGAF and ITIL are "insufficient" for modern agentic AI environments and proposes an alternative framework from first principles.
- Source 2: References TOGAF as contextual foundation; the ABMA system generates TOGAF-compatible business architecture artefacts; the paper operates within TOGAF's conceptual framework for business architecture.
- Source 3: Does not name TOGAF, but documents that only 22% of organisations have AI-ready architectures, suggesting current architectural approaches (likely TOGAF-guided in many cases) are not delivering AI readiness.
- Source 2's partnership with Capsifi (a BA modelling platform) suggests practical alignment with existing EA tooling ecosystems, which are TOGAF-centric.
- Source 1's proposed framework introduces entirely new concepts (A2A communication layers, AI security layers, MCP interfaces) that have no direct TOGAF equivalent.

## Significance

The TOGAF question is a practical flashpoint for EA practitioners: should they invest in extending their TOGAF-based approaches to accommodate AI, or should they adopt entirely new frameworks? The answer has implications for training, tooling, governance, and organisational structure. Thought leadership that provides a clear-eyed assessment of what TOGAF gets right and what it misses in the AI era -- rather than either dismissing it or uncritically defending it -- would fill a significant gap. A "TOGAF for AI" extension or a migration guide from traditional to agentic EA frameworks could be highly valuable.

## Questions to Explore

- What specific TOGAF concepts and processes remain valid in AI-native enterprise architecture, and which need replacement?
- Is The Open Group (TOGAF's custodian) working on AI-specific extensions or updates to the framework?
- How are TOGAF-certified enterprise architects actually adapting their practice for AI workloads?
- Could a hybrid approach work -- using TOGAF for strategic EA governance while adopting agentic frameworks for AI-specific architecture layers?
- What would a "TOGAF ADM for AI" look like -- an Architecture Development Method adapted for continuous learning, agentic behavior, and dynamic deployment?
