research_focus: |
  Core focus is on **practical use cases**. In addition to the standard analysis
  (findings, tensions, thought leadership angles), this topic should explicitly
  identify and catalogue concrete use cases where AI delivers value in project
  management — with evidence of adoption, measurable outcomes, and implementation
  patterns. The synthesis should include a dedicated use case inventory alongside
  the usual findings structure.

# AI in Project Management

How artificial intelligence — from predictive analytics to agentic AI — is transforming project management practices, tools, governance, and the role of the project manager. Research emphasis on practical use cases with evidence of real-world adoption and measurable outcomes.
