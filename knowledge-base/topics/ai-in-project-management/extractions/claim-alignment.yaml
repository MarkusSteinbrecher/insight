    theme: ai_replacing_pm_role
    description: "Sources disagree on whether AI will fundamentally replace PMO functions or merely augment them, with some sources framing AI as transformative enough to subsume core PMO tasks and others arguing AI cannot substitute for human PMO capabilities."
    positions:
      - source_id: source-010

        seg_ids: [seg-007]
      - source_id: source-009

        seg_ids: [seg-040, seg-016, seg-038]
    resolution: "The disagreement is partly one of timeframe: source-009 describes current-state limitations while sources 002 and 010 project future capabilities. It is also partly one of scope: source-009 focuses on high-complexity transformations where AI limitations are most severe, while the more optimistic sources discuss routine and standardizable PMO functions."

  - id: ct-002
    theme: ai_governance_urgency_vs_enablement
    description: "Sources differ on whether AI governance should be treated primarily as a constraint and control mechanism or as an enabling scaffold that supports faster and safer AI adoption."
    positions:
      - source_id: source-004
        stance: "AI governance is the most urgent priority, focused on verifying outputs, building accountability, and managing effects on well-being and critical thinking -- framed as a control mechanism against risks."

        seg_ids: [seg-018, seg-023]
    resolution: "The positions are complementary rather than strictly contradictory. Source-004 writes from a profession-wide risk perspective, while source-006 writes from a CIO implementation perspective. In practice, effective governance likely needs both dimensions."

  - id: ct-003
    theme: ai_adoption_readiness
    description: "Sources disagree on whether the primary barrier to AI value in project management is AI model capability or organizational data readiness and infrastructure."
    positions:
      - source_id: source-006

        seg_ids: [seg-010, seg-024, seg-033]
    resolution: "Both positions have merit. The truth likely varies by use case: for some applications (reporting, risk flagging), data readiness is the primary bottleneck; for others (resource assignment, dependency management), the tools themselves are not yet capable."

  - id: ct-004

      - source_id: source-011
        stance: "Most organizations still use spreadsheets, slides and other applications that have not evolved much in recent decades; the low level of maturity of available technologies is a reason for low project success rates."
        seg_ids: [seg-005, seg-022]
    resolution: "The disconnect is temporal and definitional. Source-011 analyzed literature through 2023. Sources 005 and 007 report on rapid change in 2024-2026. Both can be true simultaneously: the market is growing rapidly, but most organizations have not yet adopted the new tools."

        stance: "Communication management, risk management, and stakeholder management are among the PM knowledge areas where AI holds the most significant potential."
        seg_ids: [seg-006, seg-012]
    resolution: "The disagreement likely reflects different definitions of 'impact.' The PMI survey (source-014) measures current practitioner-perceived impact, while the academic study (source-019) assesses theoretical potential with generative AI opening new possibilities for communication and stakeholder domains."

        stance: "Education — not role or workflow redesign — is the primary talent strategy adjustment for addressing AI skills gaps."
        seg_ids: [seg-009, seg-030]
    resolution: "The sources address different aspects of the same challenge. McKinsey focuses on what drives financial returns (workflow redesign).

        stance: "Autonomous project management (Phase 4) is still largely theoretical and faces significant obstacles; the industry is only now transitioning into early Phase 3 (ML-based PM)."
        seg_ids: [seg-004, seg-013]
    resolution: "The disagreement partly reflects the publication gap (2018 vs. 2026) and partly a scope difference: KPMG describes agents assisting with specific tasks, while PwC's Phase 4 envisions fully self-driven PM."

    description: "Sources present different perspectives on whether AI enhances or degrades practitioner skills."
    positions:
      - source_id: source-029
        stance: "89% agree GenAI enhances employees' skills, but 43% simultaneously see risk of skill proficiency decline — acknowledging both effects."
        seg_ids: [seg-010, seg-019]
      - source_id: source-031
        stance: "GenAI empowers PMs to focus on higher-value skills (creativity, coaching, leadership), framing AI purely as an enhancer."
        seg_ids: [seg-012, seg-018]
      - source_id: source-026
        stance: "Only 20% of PMs have practical AI skills, and investment priorities favor technical and power skills over business acumen, suggesting a gap AI could widen."
        seg_ids: [seg-006, seg-019]
    resolution: "The tension is real and unresolved. The outcome likely depends on whether organizations invest in upskilling alongside AI deployment."

    description: "Sources identify different primary barriers to AI adoption in PM, reflecting different survey populations and maturity levels."
    positions:
      - source_id: source-023
        stance: "System complexity (65%) is the top deployment barrier, followed by cybersecurity (80% as strategic barrier)."
        seg_ids: [seg-009, seg-010]
      - source_id: source-032
        stance: "Resistance to change (26%) is the leading barrier, followed by lack of skilled personnel (19%) and data issues (17%)."
        seg_ids: [seg-011, seg-021]
      - source_id: source-024
        stance: "General adoption challenges (41%), skills gaps (39%), and workflow integration (36%) are the primary barriers."
        seg_ids: [seg-006, seg-013, seg-014, seg-015]
    resolution: "The apparent contradiction reflects different populations and maturity levels. KPMG surveyed enterprise leaders already scaling AI. Wellingtone surveyed PM practitioners. Capterra surveyed PM software buyers. The primary barrier shifts as an organization progresses along the adoption maturity curve."
