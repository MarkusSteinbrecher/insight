# Project Delivery Performance Case Is Compelling but Unproven

## Insight

The business case for AI in project management rests on a compelling narrative -- $48 trillion invested annually in projects with only a 31-35% success rate -- combined with early outcome data showing meaningful performance differentials. However, the evidence base for AI's causal contribution to improved project outcomes is notably weaker than the evidence for adoption patterns and use cases. No controlled study in the corpus isolates AI's impact from the selection effects that confound observational data, and the academic literature itself acknowledges being in an "embryonic stage."

## Evidence Chain

Multiple sources cite the same foundational statistics to establish the business case: approximately $48 trillion invested in projects globally each year, yet only 31-35% are considered successful (source-005, source-011, source-032). This "burning platform" creates the narrative foundation for AI-assisted project management (cc-061). The gap between investment and outcomes is substantial enough that even modest improvements in delivery rates would represent significant value.

The available outcome data is directionally positive. PMI research indicates that companies using AI-driven tools achieve 61% on-time delivery versus 47% without, 69% business benefits realization versus 53%, and 64% meeting ROI estimates versus 52% (source-030). KPMG reports 15% average productivity improvements for companies investing in AI (source-030). The Wharton/GBK study (source-029) finds that 75% of leaders report positive returns on GenAI investments.

However, these figures carry significant methodological limitations. The PMI performance differential -- the closest approximation to a comparative outcome study in the corpus -- does not control for selection effects. Organizations with more mature project management practices are both more likely to adopt AI tools and more likely to deliver projects successfully, creating a confound that makes it impossible to attribute the performance gap to AI specifically (cc-006). Self-reported ROI assessments (59% expect measurable ROI within 12 months, per source-023; 75% report positive returns, per source-029) lack methodological transparency and are subject to confirmation bias.

The academic literature explicitly acknowledges the evidence gap. Source-012 notes that the scientific literature on AI's impact in project management is "still in an embryonic stage" (cc-026). Source-011's systematic literature review confirms that rigorous empirical studies of AI's effect on project outcomes are scarce, with most academic work focused on conceptual frameworks, literature reviews, or single-case studies rather than controlled comparisons.

The gap between aspiration and achievement is quantified from another angle: 74% of organizations hope for revenue growth from AI, but only 20% are currently achieving it. This 54-percentage-point gap between expectation and realization suggests that the business case, while compelling in theory, has not yet been broadly validated in practice.

## Significance

The unproven performance case matters because it affects how organizations should frame their AI investments. If the evidence were strong, aggressive investment would be justified by expected returns. With the current evidence base, organizations should invest in AI for project management based on specific, measurable use case value (time saved on reporting, improved risk identification) rather than on aggregated outcome claims that cannot yet be attributed to AI. The distinction between "organizations using AI perform better" and "AI causes organizations to perform better" is not academic -- it determines whether AI adoption is a sufficient condition for improvement or whether it must be accompanied by other organizational changes.

## Gap

The most significant gap in the corpus is the absence of a controlled study comparing project outcomes with and without AI tools, controlling for organizational maturity, project complexity, and selection effects. Until such evidence exists, the performance case for AI in project management remains correlational rather than causal. Longitudinal before-and-after studies within organizations adopting AI would also strengthen the evidence base substantially.
