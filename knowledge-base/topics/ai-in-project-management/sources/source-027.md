# Announcing The Forrester Wave: Collaborative Work Management Tools, Q2 2025

## Summary
Forrester's Q2 2025 Wave evaluation of Collaborative Work Management (CWM) tools assessed 11 vendors — Adobe, Airtable, Asana, Atlassian, ClickUp, monday.com, Quickbase, ServiceNow, Smartsheet, Wrike, and Zoho — across 15 current-offering criteria and 8 strategy criteria. Each vendor was evaluated through a questionnaire, executive strategy briefings and demos, and interviews with up to three reference customers. The evaluation reflects a market in rapid evolution, where AI-driven capabilities are becoming central to competitive differentiation.

The report's key insight for project management practitioners is that CWM tools have evolved beyond project or task planning to empower users to act, drive outcomes, and perform work proactively. Three critical considerations emerge: integration depth is crucial (beyond surface-level, assessing flexibility and scalability), AI depends on data quality (clean, well-structured, accessible data is essential for reliable AI outputs), and project portfolio management remains essential — CWM solutions are not yet full replacements for traditional PPM systems. The portfolio management gap is particularly notable: governance, scalability, and robust data models required for enterprise-scale planning are still maturing in many CWM platforms.

## Key Takeaways
- Forrester evaluated 11 CWM vendors: Adobe, Airtable, Asana, Atlassian, ClickUp, monday.com, Quickbase, ServiceNow, Smartsheet, Wrike, Zoho
- Evaluation covered 15 current-offering criteria and 8 strategy criteria
- CWM tools have evolved from project/task planning to outcome-driven work platforms
- AI capabilities are no longer optional — they are central to competitive differentiation in PM tools
- AI value depends on data quality: clean, well-structured, accessible data is a prerequisite for reliable AI-driven recommendations
- CWM platforms are not yet full replacements for traditional Project Portfolio Management (PPM) systems
- Portfolio management at enterprise scale requires governance, scalability, and robust data models still maturing in CWM
- Integration depth with the broader tech ecosystem is essential — surface-level integrations are insufficient
- Organizations are starting to implement CWM tools as a system of record for work
- The CWM market continues fast-paced growth with expanded capabilities

## Notable Quotes
> "AI can be a powerful accelerator for productivity, but its value is only as strong as the data it relies on — clean, well-structured, and accessible data is essential for generating reliable outputs and building trust in AI-driven recommendations." — Forrester Wave, Q2 2025

> "CWM solutions are flexible and allow for proactive work, but they are not yet full replacements for traditional PPM systems." — Forrester Wave, Q2 2025

## Relevance to Topic
This Forrester evaluation provides an authoritative assessment of the AI capabilities embedded in mainstream PM tools that enterprise practitioners actually use. The finding that CWM tools are not yet PPM replacements is particularly important — it suggests organizations need a layered approach where AI-enhanced CWM handles execution while separate PPM capabilities handle governance and portfolio-level decisions. The data quality prerequisite for AI effectiveness reinforces findings from other sources in this collection.
