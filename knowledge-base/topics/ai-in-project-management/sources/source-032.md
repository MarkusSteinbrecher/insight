# The State of Project Management Annual Report 2025

## Summary
Wellingtone's annual State of Project Management Report, published since 2016, captures insights from hundreds of industry professionals on the current landscape of project management in the UK and globally. The 2025 edition covers PM maturity, essential tools and techniques, project success rates, and PMO effectiveness. Data is collected through an extensive questionnaire, rigorously analyzed, anonymized, and also shared with leading universities for academic research.

The report reveals persistent challenges in project delivery alongside growing PMO adoption. Only 31% of projects are reported as successful (on time, on budget, on scope), while 82% of organizations now operate one or more PMOs. A critical finding: 42% of respondents spend one or more days each month manually collating project reports — representing a clear automation opportunity for AI. Resource management, benefits management, and project prioritization are identified as the three most difficult PM processes to embed. On the AI front, the report finds that organizations plan to increase AI investments by 36%, and by 2026 an estimated 80% of PMOs are expected to use AI for decision-making. However, significant barriers remain: resistance to change from team members (26%), lack of skilled personnel (19%), data integration and quality issues (17%), and high costs and budget restraints (15%).

## Relevance to Topic
This report provides the ground-level practitioner perspective on PM operations, revealing the specific pain points that AI could address (manual reporting, lack of real-time KPIs, resource management). The 42% manual reporting statistic directly quantifies the efficiency opportunity for AI in PM. The barrier analysis — led by resistance to change (26%) rather than technology limitations — suggests that the challenge of AI adoption in PM is primarily organizational and cultural, not technical. The certification gap (53% of projects run by non-certified PMs) also raises questions about how AI tools will be adopted by practitioners with varying levels of PM maturity.
