# Accenture Technology Vision 2025: AI-Powered Autonomy and Enterprise Reinvention

## Summary
The 25th annual Accenture Technology Vision, informed by surveys of more than 4,000 executives across 21 industries and 28 countries, plus over 12,000 consumers, explores how AI-powered autonomy is reshaping enterprise operations. The central thesis: a new era of digitization is unfolding in which AI continuously learns and drives new levels of autonomy across organizations, positioning trust in its performance as the most important measure for AI to achieve its promise.

The report identifies trust as the critical enabler: 77% of executives believe the true benefits of AI will only be possible when built on a foundation of trust, and 81% agree that trust strategy must evolve in parallel with technology strategy. The vision spans four dimensions: technology development (gen AI coding assistants elevating developers to systems engineers, shifting from static application architecture to intention-based frameworks and agentic systems), customer experience (80% of executives worry LLMs could give every brand a similar voice), the physical world (generalist robots emerging over the next decade), and workforce transformation (80% of leaders prioritize ensuring a positive relationship trajectory between people and AI). The report notes that AI diffusion is accelerating faster than any prior technology, with 69% of executives believing this brings new urgency to reinvention.

## Key Takeaways
- 69% of executives believe AI brings new urgency to reinvention of technology systems and processes
- 77% of executives believe the true benefits of AI will only be possible when built on a foundation of trust
- 81% agree that trust strategy must evolve in parallel with technology strategy
- 80% of executives worry LLMs and chatbots could give every brand a similar voice
- 80% of leaders prioritize ensuring a positive relationship trajectory between people and AI
- Gen AI coding assistants are elevating the role of developer to systems engineer
- Shift from static application architecture to intention-based frameworks and agentic systems
- Multi-agent systems becoming more capable, adaptive, and personalized
- Accenture platforms (GenWizard, SynOps, AI Refinery) offer prebuilt industry agents and workflows
- Trust means digital systems and AI models are more accurate, predictable, consistent, and traceable — beyond responsible use of AI
- Survey covered 4,000+ executives across 21 industries and 28 countries, plus 12,000+ consumers

## Notable Quotes
> "Unlocking the benefits of AI will only be possible if leaders seize the opportunity to inject and develop trust in its performance and outcomes in a systematic manner." — Julie Sweet, Chair and CEO, Accenture

> "The autonomy created by these generalized AI systems can help organizations be more dynamic and intention-driven than ever. It will allow leaders to rethink how digital systems are designed, how people work, and reinvent how they create products and interact with customers. But trust underpins it all, as systems will only ever be as autonomous as they are trustworthy." — Karthik Narain, Group Chief Executive, Technology and CTO, Accenture

## Relevance to Topic
While not PM-specific, this report provides critical context on the trust dimension of AI adoption that directly applies to project management. The finding that systems are "only ever as autonomous as they are trustworthy" is particularly relevant for agentic PM tools that make autonomous scheduling, resource allocation, or risk assessment decisions. The shift from static architectures to intention-based and agentic systems maps onto the evolution of PM tools from passive tracking to autonomous project assistance. The scale of the research (4,000+ executives, 12,000+ consumers) across 21 industries provides a robust foundation for cross-industry insights.
