# AI is Still No Replacement for PMO Excellence

## Summary
A practitioner perspective from Ed Davies of Project One, published on Consultancy.uk, that provides a critical counterpoint to the prevailing narrative of AI replacing PMO functions. The article systematically examines three categories of AI capability -- generative AI for content creation, analytic AI for cutting through noise, and predictive AI for forecasting -- and argues that each has significant limitations that prevent it from substituting for skilled human PMO work.

The article draws an analogy to IKEA's insight about the value of self-assembly (ownership through creation) to argue that AI-generated project artifacts reduce team ownership and commitment. It also identifies specific failure modes of AI in project management contexts, including loss of context in meeting summaries, inability to handle organizational shorthand and acronyms, and the "garbage in, garbage out" problem with AI-generated insights from poor-quality project data.

## Key Takeaways
- Generative AI can create transformation content (schedules, risk logs, status reports) very quickly, but documentation alone does not make change happen -- value only comes from use
- The "IKEA effect" applies to project management: when teams are handed AI-generated artifacts rather than creating them collaboratively, they lose ownership and commitment
- AI-generated meeting summaries frequently fail because AI lacks organizational context, cannot interpret acronyms, shorthand, or incomplete sentences, and "dangerously fills in gaps with incorrect guesses"
- AI insights from status reports and risk logs are only as good as the underlying data -- if risks are not clearly articulated or reports miss key information, AI cannot compensate
- Current AI models lack situational and contextual awareness to judge whether statistical relationships they identify are rational or causal
- Large complex transformations are by their nature unusual, taking organizations "outside of the established dataset" -- meaning AI predictions become less accurate precisely when stakes are highest
- Strong PMO adds value through coaching, training, and embedding practices through human relationships and interaction -- skills AI cannot replicate
- The article distinguishes between problems where AI can help (content creation speed, noise reduction) and problems it cannot solve (team commitment, contextual judgment, organizational change management)
- AI works best when supporting an existing strong PMO, not as a substitute for one

## Notable Quotes
> "A well-known Swedish furniture company recognised the value of creating things yourself. When customers bolted together their own flat pack bookcase, they gained a much greater sense of ownership than having a fully assembled item arrive in a van."

> "Whenever you're undertaking a large, complex change -- it's by its very nature unusual. For your organisation you're going outside of the established dataset into a new world."

> "Documentation and a stack of paperwork doesn't make change happen. Change and value only come from use."

## Relevance to Topic
This source provides an essential critical counterbalance to the predominantly optimistic narratives around AI in project management. Its analysis of specific failure modes (context loss, ownership deficit, data quality dependence, statistical limitations for novel situations) is grounded in practitioner experience rather than theoretical skepticism. The IKEA effect analogy and the distinction between content creation and change management are distinctive analytical contributions that are not found in other sources.
