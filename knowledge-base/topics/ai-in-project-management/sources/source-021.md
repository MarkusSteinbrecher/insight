# The State of AI in 2025: Agents, Innovation, and Transformation

## Summary
McKinsey's eighth annual global survey on AI, published in November 2025, tracks the evolution of AI adoption across enterprises worldwide. Based on responses from 1,993 participants across 105 nations, the report finds that 88% of organizations now use AI in at least one business function, up from 20% in 2017. However, 67% of organizations remain stuck in "pilot mode," unable to scale AI beyond initial experiments.

The report identifies a growing gap between AI high performers and the rest. Only 39% of organizations report any enterprise-wide EBIT impact from AI, and the impact is typically under 5%. The redesign of workflows emerges as the single most important factor in realizing EBIT impact from generative AI. Organizations that establish dedicated teams to drive gen AI adoption — including project management offices, transformation offices, or dedicated adoption and scaling teams — are more likely to succeed. The report also highlights the emergence of agentic AI, with 23% of respondents reporting their organizations are scaling an agentic AI system and an additional 39% experimenting with AI agents.

## Key Takeaways
- 88% of organizations now use AI in at least one business function, up from 20% in 2017
- 67% of organizations are still stuck in "pilot mode" and unable to scale AI beyond experiments
- Only 39% of organizations report any level of enterprise-wide EBIT impact from AI, typically under 5%
- 64% of organizations see innovation gains from AI, but enterprise-level financial impact remains elusive for most
- Workflow redesign has the biggest effect on an organization's ability to see EBIT impact from gen AI
- Organizations succeeding with AI are establishing dedicated teams (PMOs, transformation offices, scaling teams)
- 23% of respondents report scaling an agentic AI system; 39% are experimenting with AI agents
- 48% of AI high performers strongly agree that senior leaders demonstrate ownership and commitment to AI initiatives, compared to 16% among all other companies
- Survey covered 1,993 participants across 105 nations

## Notable Quotes
> "The redesign of workflows has the biggest effect on an organization's ability to see EBIT impact from its use of gen AI." — McKinsey State of AI 2025

> "Organizations that are succeeding include those establishing a dedicated team to drive gen AI adoption — for example, a project management office, transformation office, or dedicated adoption and scaling team." — McKinsey State of AI 2025

## Relevance to Topic
This report provides the broadest enterprise-level context for AI adoption and directly identifies PMOs and transformation offices as critical success factors. The finding that workflow redesign — not technology selection — drives financial impact is particularly relevant for project management practitioners considering AI integration. The scale of the survey (nearly 2,000 respondents across 105 countries) makes it a high-credibility benchmark.
