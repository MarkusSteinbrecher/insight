# The State of AI in the Enterprise: 2026 AI Report

## Summary
Deloitte's 2026 State of AI in the Enterprise report tracks the shift from AI ambition to activation across global organizations. The report identifies that organizations stand at the "untapped edge" of AI's potential, with worker access to AI rising by 50% in 2025. The number of companies with 40% or more of their AI projects in production is set to double in six months, signaling a transition from piloting to scaling.

The report finds that twice as many leaders as last year report transformative AI impact, but only 34% are truly reimagining their business through AI. Productivity and efficiency top the list of achieved benefits (66% of organizations), followed by enhanced insights and decision-making (53%), cost reduction (40%), and enhanced client/customer relationships (38%). Revenue growth remains largely aspirational, with 74% hoping to grow revenue through AI compared to just 20% currently achieving it. The report also highlights critical gaps: the AI skills gap is seen as the biggest barrier to integration, with education — not role or workflow redesign — being the primary talent strategy adjustment. Agentic AI usage is poised to rise sharply, but oversight is lagging, with only one in five companies having a mature governance model for autonomous AI agents.

## Relevance to Topic
This report provides a comprehensive view of enterprise AI maturity that directly applies to project management. The finding that skills gaps — rather than technology — represent the biggest barrier mirrors challenges in PM AI adoption. The governance gap for agentic AI (only 1 in 5 companies with mature models) is particularly relevant as PM tools increasingly incorporate autonomous agents. The contrast between strategic readiness (42%) and operational preparedness across infrastructure, data, risk, and talent illuminates the gap that PMOs must bridge.
