# Boosting Business Acumen: PMI Pulse of the Profession 2025

## Summary
The 2025 PMI Pulse of the Profession report, based on a survey of nearly 3,000 project professionals worldwide, focuses on business acumen as a key factor in driving project success. While AI is not the primary focus, the report provides essential context for understanding how AI fits into the broader competency landscape of project management. Only 18% of project professionals demonstrate high business acumen proficiency, yet these individuals achieve significantly better outcomes: 27% lower failure rates and 5 percentage points better goal achievement.

The report finds that only approximately 20% of project managers report having extensive or good practical AI skills, highlighting a significant capability gap in the profession. High business acumen professionals use an average of 9.1 factors to measure project performance versus 6.3 for other professionals, and 83% consider customer satisfaction a performance metric (versus 66%). The report positions business acumen and technological competency as complementary capabilities, suggesting that project professionals who master both become "indispensable strategic partners." Despite senior leaders acknowledging the need for new business acumen skills (54%), investment priorities still favor technical skills (64%) and power skills (61%) over business acumen development.

## Relevance to Topic
This report provides an essential counterpoint to the technology-focused AI narrative: business acumen — not AI proficiency — is PMI's identified differentiator for high-performing project professionals. The low AI skills rate (~20% with practical competence) alongside the low business acumen rate (18% with high proficiency) suggests that the profession faces a dual capability gap. For AI adoption in PM, this implies that technical AI capability alone is insufficient; project professionals need business judgment to determine where and how AI adds value. The stakeholder management emphasis (93% prioritize it for scope challenges) also underscores the human competencies that AI cannot replace.
