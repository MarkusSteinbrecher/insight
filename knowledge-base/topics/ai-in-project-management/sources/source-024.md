# AI in Project Management: 2025 Software Trends Report

## Summary
Capterra's 2025 Project Management Software Trends Survey, conducted in July 2025 among 2,545 respondents across 11 countries (Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, India, Italy, Mexico, Spain, UK, and US), provides one of the most comprehensive quantitative assessments of AI adoption in PM software purchasing. The survey's central finding is that AI has become the primary driver of PM software investment: 55% of buyers reported that AI was the top trigger for their most recent PM software purchase.

The report maps current AI usage across PM functions: 54% of project managers use AI for risk management, 53% for task automation, 52% for predictive analysis and forecasting, 52% for schedule optimization, and 47% for resource planning and allocation. However, adoption faces significant barriers: 41% of project managers said AI adoption is a challenge, 39% reported a lack of AI skills on staff, and 36% said integrating new tools into existing workflows is a significant hurdle. The report also identifies that AI is raising the stakes for security, with organizations grappling with new security risks alongside the productivity opportunities. A regional variant found that 57% of Canadian project managers cited AI as the trigger for a PM software purchase in the previous year, even amid budgetary constraints.
