# KPMG AI Quarterly Pulse Survey: AI at Scale

## Summary
KPMG's Q4 2025 AI Quarterly Pulse Survey, released January 2026, reveals that enterprise AI has shifted decisively from experimentation to production-grade scaling. Based on eight consecutive quarters of proprietary research, the report finds that organizations are "professionalizing" their AI agent systems rather than simply deploying more agents. Average AI investment climbed from $114M in Q1 to $130M in Q3 2025, with 67% of leaders indicating they will maintain AI spending even in a recession. Agent deployment surged from 11% in Q1 to 26% by Q4 2025.

The survey surfaces a critical finding for project management: 44% of leaders expect AI agents to take lead roles in managing specific projects alongside human teams over the next 2-3 years. This represents a fundamental shift in how project delivery may be structured. System complexity has replaced other concerns as the No. 1 deployment challenge, with 65% of leaders citing agentic system complexity as the top barrier. Cybersecurity is the single greatest barrier to achieving AI strategy goals (80% of leaders), with data privacy (77%) and data quality (65%) rising sharply as concerns.

## Key Takeaways
- 44% of leaders expect AI agents to take lead roles in managing specific projects alongside human teams in 2-3 years
- AI investment averaged $124M per enterprise, projected over the coming year; 67% will maintain spending even in recession
- Agent deployment surged from 11% (Q1 2025) to 26% (Q4 2025), more than doubling
- 59% of enterprises expect measurable ROI within 12 months
- 65% of leaders cite agentic system complexity as the top deployment barrier for two consecutive quarters
- 80% of leaders say cybersecurity is the single greatest barrier to achieving AI strategy goals (up from 68% in Q1)
- 64% of organizations have already altered entry-level hiring approaches due to AI agents' influence (up from 18% previous quarter)
- 76% of leaders willing to offer up to 10% higher compensation for candidates with strong AI skills
- 40% of leaders say board members now have substantial AI expertise (five-fold increase from 8% two quarters prior)
- New roles emerging: AI prompt engineer, AI performance analyst, AI trainer/data curator

## Notable Quotes
> "AI isn't just an investment, it's becoming the backbone of enterprise strategy. What the numbers don't show is the growing divide: while some organizations stall after early deployments, the leaders are scaling fast and pulling ahead." — Steve Chase, Vice Chair of AI and Digital Innovation, KPMG LLP

> "2026 will be the year we begin to see orchestrated super-agent ecosystems, governed end-to-end by robust control systems that drive measurable outcomes and continuous improvement." — Swami Chandrasekaran, Global Head of KPMG AI and Data Labs

> "The topline adoption number undersells what's actually happening among leaders. They're not pulling back, they're professionalizing their agents and agent systems." — Steve Chase, KPMG

## Relevance to Topic
This is one of the most directly relevant sources for AI in project management. The finding that 44% of leaders expect AI agents to co-lead projects is a signal of fundamental change in PM practice. The shift from "deploying agents" to "professionalizing agent systems" mirrors the PMO maturation journey. The emphasis on system complexity as the top barrier, rather than technical capability, suggests that orchestration and governance — traditional PMO competencies — become more important as AI scales. The quarterly longitudinal data provides trend visibility that point-in-time surveys cannot.
