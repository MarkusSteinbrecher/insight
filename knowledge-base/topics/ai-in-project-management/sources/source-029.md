# Accountable Acceleration: Gen AI Fast-Tracks Into the Enterprise

## Summary
The third annual Wharton/GBK Collective study tracks generative AI's trajectory from exploration (2023) through experimentation (2024) to "accountable acceleration" (2025). Surveying approximately 800 U.S. executives, the study documents a clear maturation pattern: weekly GenAI usage rose from 37% (2023) to 72% (2024) to 82% (2025), with daily usage now at 46%. The 2025 report's central theme is the pivot from speculative adoption to rigorous, disciplined pursuit of value — what the authors term "accountable acceleration."

The study finds that 72% of leaders now formally measure GenAI ROI, focusing on productivity gains and incremental profit. Three out of four leaders report positive returns on their initial AI investments. Looking ahead, 88% anticipate GenAI budget increases in the next 12 months, with 62% expecting increases above 10%. About one-third of GenAI technology budgets are being allocated to internal R&D, indicating enterprises are building custom capabilities. The study also identifies a tension: 89% agree GenAI enhances employees' skills, yet 43% see risk of declines in skill proficiency — echoing concerns about AI-driven deskilling. Chief AI Officer roles are now present in 61% of enterprises.

## Key Takeaways
- Weekly GenAI usage: 37% (2023) to 72% (2024) to 82% (2025); daily usage now at 46%
- Three-wave evolution: Exploration (2023) to Experimentation (2024) to Accountable Acceleration (2025)
- 72% of leaders formally measure GenAI ROI, focusing on productivity gains and incremental profit
- 75% of leaders report positive returns on GenAI investments
- 88% anticipate GenAI budget increases in next 12 months; 62% expect increases above 10%
- About one-third of GenAI budgets allocated to internal R&D — building custom capabilities
- 89% agree GenAI enhances employees' skills, but 43% see risk of skill proficiency decline
- Chief AI Officer roles present in 61% of enterprises (up significantly)
- IT and Purchasing/Procurement lead on adoption frequency and confidence; Marketing/Sales and Operations lag
- Most effective use cases: data analysis, document summarization, and document editing/writing
- Training, hiring, and rollout approaches are key human capital aspects for success
- Four out of five leaders see GenAI investments paying off in about two to three years

## Notable Quotes
> "The next phase is not about adoption; it is about advantage. The companies that thrive will be those that pair measurable ROI with responsible integration and build a culture where people have the skills to grow with AI." — Jeremy Korst, Partner, GBK Collective

> "The challenge isn't replacement, it's readiness. Companies that invest in training, culture, and guardrails will be the ones that turn Everyday AI into long-term advantage." — Stefano Puntoni, Wharton School

> "Leaders are no longer content to run pilots. They want proof. Gen AI is being held to the same standards as other major investments, and that is a sign of increasing maturity." — Sonny Tambe, Wharton School

## Relevance to Topic
This longitudinal study provides the strongest evidence for the shift from experimentation to accountability in enterprise AI. While not PM-specific, the findings directly apply: the demand for measurable ROI from AI investments will increasingly reach PM tools and practices. The tension between skill enhancement (89%) and skill degradation risk (43%) is highly relevant to the project management profession's concerns about AI replacing PMs. The identification of data analysis and document summarization as top use cases aligns with the PM tasks most amenable to AI automation.
