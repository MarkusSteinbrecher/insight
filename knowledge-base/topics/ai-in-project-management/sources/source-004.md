# AI & Project Management: 2025 Review and 2026 Trends -- Boon or Bubble?

## Summary
A comprehensive practitioner-oriented analysis that reviews AI developments in project management across 2025 and projects trends for 2026. The article is built around an interview with James Garner (Chair of the Project Data Analytics Taskforce) and Yoshi Soornack of Project Flux, supplemented by author Mike Clayton's own analysis structured around three themes: adoption and governance, the PM profession's response, and threats and warnings.

The article stands out for its critical, nuanced assessment of both the professional bodies' responses to AI (PMI and APM) and the real-world challenges emerging. It introduces several notable concepts: the "Illusion of Intelligence," confidence scoring for AI hallucinations, "Shadow AI" as a project integrity risk, and the shift from task-tracker to strategic lead. It also documents specific events including the Deloitte Australia fee repayment incident and government AI policy memoranda.

## Key Takeaways
- PMI's 8th edition PMBOK (December 2025) includes only a short 8-page AI overview in Appendix 3, described as "provisional" and "tentative"
- APM's Body of Knowledge 8th edition (summer 2025) contains a more thoughtful 11-page survey of AI in Chapter 6, though not fully integrated into the content
- Professional services sector saw layoffs in 2025 driven by two factors: removing reluctant AI adopters and reducing headcount through perceived AI efficiency savings
- Deloitte Australia was forced to repay fees to the Australian government after a report was found to contain AI-generated errors
- US government issued two key AI policy memoranda in 2025 covering AI use and procurement; UK published its Artificial Intelligence Playbook for Government
- "Shadow AI" -- teams using AI tools privately without shared norms -- is identified as a major risk to project integrity
- Confidence scoring is proposed as a method to manage AI hallucinations in project management outputs
- "AI Slop" (low-quality AI-generated content flooding professional channels) and "AI Psychosis" (over-reliance on AI capabilities, coined by Microsoft's Mustafa Suleyman) are emerging concerns
- The shift from AI experimentation in 2025 to full-scale deployment in 2026 requires immediate focus on AI governance: verifying outputs, building accountability, and managing effects on well-being and critical thinking
- Author calls for professional bodies to conduct rigorous review of real potential futures for AI in PM practice and create resulting guidance

## Notable Quotes
> "PMI's inclusion of AI in the new 8th edition of its Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK8) seems provisional at best and, in truth, rather tentative."

> "We have seen too much AI-generated slop and recycled, shoddy thinking."

> "In 2026, we must get a handle on AI governance. We need to be able to verify the outputs from our AI tools, build accountability for the AI + HI (Human Intelligence) systems that we create, and manage the effects on people's well-being and critical thinking capabilities."

## Relevance to Topic
This is one of the most analytically rich sources in this collection. It provides critical assessment of the professional bodies' responses, documents real-world failures, and introduces specific concepts (Shadow AI, confidence scoring, AI Slop) that are directly relevant to understanding the risks and governance challenges of AI in project management. The practitioner perspective and specific event documentation make it a strong complement to the more institutional or vendor-oriented sources.
