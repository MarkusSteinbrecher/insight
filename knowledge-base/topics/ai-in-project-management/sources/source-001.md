# How AI is Transforming Project Management in 2026

## Summary
A comprehensive feature article from TechTarget examining how AI is being embedded across the project management discipline. The article draws on multiple expert sources including analysts from Capterra, Info-Tech Research Group, and academics from Montclair State University. It covers current AI use cases in project management, from administrative automation to risk management, and assesses where AI excels and where it faces limitations.

The article is structured around four major areas of AI application: administrative tasks, planning tasks, scenario analysis, and the question of whether AI will replace project managers. It highlights that AI's most successful applications are currently at the "front and tail ends" of projects -- planning, brainstorming, and reporting -- while core execution tasks remain largely human-driven due to data readiness challenges.

## Key Takeaways
- According to Capterra's 2025 Project Management Software Trends Survey, 55% of buyers reported that "AI was the top trigger for their most recent purchase"
- Task automation, forecasting, and risk management are the most common uses of AI in project management
- Capterra's 2024 Most Impactful PM Tools Survey found: 54% used AI for project risk management, 53% for task automation, 52% for predictive analysis and forecasting, 52% for schedule optimization, and 47% for resource planning and allocation
- AI is most effective at the "front end" (planning, brainstorming, risk analysis, drafting schedules, identifying stakeholders) and "tail end" (reports, summaries) of projects
- AI can estimate project costs by analyzing past projects and current prices, sometimes more accurately than human project managers
- Resource allocation via AI requires comprehensive organizational data that most organizations do not yet have -- a key limiting factor
- AI algorithms can identify potential threats to project success by analyzing multiple data sets, and increasingly offer risk mitigation strategies
- Experts do not foresee AI making project managers obsolete, but expect it to reduce the number of project managers organizations need to hire

## Notable Quotes
> "AI is going to transform projects in the near term by improving administration, and it's going to improve project management in the long term by lowering risk." — Barry Cousins, Distinguished Analyst and Research Fellow, Info-Tech Research Group

> "If you're going to use AI to figure out whether I'm the best person to assign and when I'm free, then you need that data, and you need that data for everyone. I can't say when organizations are going to have that data ready." — Barry Cousins, Info-Tech Research Group

> "This isn't about chasing shiny features. It's about tackling rising project complexity, resource constraints and the demand for speed." — Olivia Montgomery, Associate Principal Analyst, Capterra

> "With a simple prompt, you get a lot of great ideas. That means you don't have to start with a blank sheet." — Te Wu, CEO and Chief Project Officer, PMO Advisory

## Relevance to Topic
This is a strong foundational source that provides a well-structured, multi-expert view of AI's current and near-term role in project management. It combines survey data from Capterra with practitioner and analyst perspectives, making it valuable for understanding both the state of adoption and the practical constraints organizations face. The distinction between where AI works well today (admin, planning, reporting) versus where it is limited (execution, resource allocation) is a key analytical frame.
