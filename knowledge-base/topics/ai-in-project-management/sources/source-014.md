# Artificial Intelligence and Project Management: A Global Chapter-Led Survey 2024

## Summary
This comprehensive survey report, led by PMI Sweden Chapter in collaboration with 27 PMI chapters worldwide, presents findings from 2,314 project management professionals across 129 countries. The survey ran from June to September 2023, providing a global snapshot of AI maturity, adoption, and attitudes in the project management community. It represents the largest community-led study of its kind on AI in project management.

The report tests four hypotheses: (1) AI adoption is still in early stages but accelerating, (2) AI adoption varies by region, (3) organizations lagging in AI adoption will struggle to attract talent, and (4) the PM community deems certain AI skills necessary for competitive advantage. Findings largely confirm these hypotheses. Comparing 2022 Sweden-only data with 2023 global data, the perceived impact of AI on PM increased substantially (high impact ratings rose from 40% to 66% in Sweden alone), while organizational implementation has not kept pace.

The survey also includes market analysis (the global AI in PM market was estimated at USD 2.5B in 2023, projected to reach USD 7.7B by 2030 at 17.3% CAGR), regional analyses across six continents, and perspectives from 15 AI specialists. The report identifies data collection/reporting, performance monitoring, and project time management/scheduling as the PM areas most impacted by AI, while stakeholder management, project communication, and project budgeting show the lowest AI impact.

## Relevance to Topic
This is the most geographically comprehensive empirical survey of AI attitudes and maturity in the project management community. With 2,314 respondents from 129 countries, it provides the definitive baseline for understanding where the PM profession stands on AI adoption. The gap between individual awareness (76% expect transformation) and organizational maturity (60% rate it 4 or below) is a central finding that shapes strategy for both practitioners and institutions. The regional comparisons and market sizing data make this an essential foundational source.
