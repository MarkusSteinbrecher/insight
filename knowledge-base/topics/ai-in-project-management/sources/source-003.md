# Beyond Disruption: Embedding AI in Project Management to Drive Enterprise Transformation

## Summary
Written by Jennifer Duignan, Principal of PMO Managed Services at PwC US, this article synthesizes observations from the PMI Global Summit 2025 in Barcelona with PwC's own AI transformation experience. The piece argues that AI is no longer a disruptive force to be feared but an essential enabler for project and PMO leaders. It connects three strategic perspectives -- managed services, enterprise transformation, and AI integration -- to make the case for immediate action.

The article is particularly notable for its first-party evidence: PwC's own investments in AI (becoming the first enterprise reseller of OpenAI, spending $1 billion to expand AI offerings, launching an AI agent operating system) and their internal deployment of a knowledge management AI for PMO teams. It positions AI as central to modern project delivery across forecasting, talent alignment, and program execution.

## Key Takeaways
- Four out of ten CEOs believe their company will not be viable in 10 years if it stays on its current path (PwC Annual Global CEO Survey)
- 42% of CEOs believe their companies will not be viable in 10 years if they remain on their current paths
- Almost half of CEOs say their biggest priorities over the next three years are integrating AI (including GenAI) into technology platforms and business processes
- PwC developed a knowledge management AI that helps PMO teams get up to speed faster and find resources to expedite client delivery
- PwC created a Responsible AI toolkit with customizable frameworks, tools, and processes to address unique risks of AI and GenAI
- PwC became the first enterprise reseller of OpenAI and spent $1 billion to expand and scale AI offerings
- PwC launched an AI agent operating system to revolutionize AI workflows
- AI is being embedded into strategic PMO services for forecasting, talent alignment, and program delivery with speed and precision
- PMO bottlenecks can create gaps between strategy and execution, and AI integration addresses this gap

## Notable Quotes
> "AI isn't coming. It's already here -- and it's changing how we lead and deliver projects."

> "What used to be considered disruptive is now essential. Doing nothing with AI can mean missing opportunities."

> "Project managers and PMOs who can seamlessly integrate [AI] can be much more impactful, and those who don't make the jump risk being left behind."
