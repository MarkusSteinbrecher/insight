# Artificial Intelligence and Project Management: Empirical Overview, State of the Art, and Guidelines for Future Research

## Summary
Published in the Project Management Journal (SAGE, PMI's flagship academic journal), this paper by the journal's editors and collaborators addresses the high desk rejection rates of AI-related submissions to the journal. The authors provide an empirical overview and state-of-the-art snapshot of both academic and practitioner work on AI in project management, and derive potential topics for future research along with guidelines on the execution and reporting of AI-related studies.

The paper is significant because it comes from the editorial leadership of the most authoritative academic journal in the project management field. It scopes the current state of AI research in project management, identifies where the field stands empirically, and provides explicit guidance for researchers on how to produce higher-quality AI-PM studies. This makes it both a diagnostic assessment and a methodological guide for the academic community.

The authors note that the scientific literature on AI in project management is still relatively immature, with many submissions failing to meet rigorous research standards. The paper identifies the gap between practitioner enthusiasm for AI tools and the academic rigor needed to build a solid evidence base. It provides practical survey results on AI implementations in organizations and outlines specific topics and methodological guidelines for future research.
