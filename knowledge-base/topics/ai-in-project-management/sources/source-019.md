# Artificial Intelligence Tools for Project Management: A Knowledge-Based Perspective

## Summary
Published in Project Leadership and Society (Elsevier, Volume 6, December 2025), this open-access empirical research paper explores how organizations can integrate AI into project management by examining the relationship between PM knowledge areas and the most suitable types of AI tools. Through a systematic literature review and thematic analysis, the study proposes a conceptual framework that matches AI tools to PM domains based on the dominant knowledge type each area requires -- formal, data-driven, or tacit knowledge.

The key contribution is the classification of PM knowledge areas by their dominant knowledge type and the subsequent matching to appropriate AI tools. The study finds that integration management, scope management, communication management, risk management, and stakeholder management are the PM knowledge areas where AI holds the most significant potential. However, the type of AI tool best suited differs by area: generative AI is better suited for domains requiring tacit knowledge (like communication and stakeholder management), while machine learning algorithms for optimization and automation fit domains requiring formal and data-driven knowledge (like cost and schedule management).

This knowledge-based perspective is a novel contribution to the field, offering a more nuanced view than the common approach of simply listing AI applications. By grounding the framework in knowledge management theory, the study provides a principled basis for deciding which AI tools to deploy in which PM contexts.

## Key Takeaways
- Proposes a conceptual framework linking AI tools to PM knowledge areas based on knowledge type (formal, data-driven, tacit)
- Identifies five PM knowledge areas with strongest AI potential: integration, scope, communication, risk, and stakeholder management
- Generative AI is best suited for tacit-knowledge domains (communication, stakeholder engagement)
- Machine learning algorithms (optimization, automation) are best suited for formal/data-driven domains (cost, schedule)
- Systematic literature review methodology with thematic analysis
- Offers guidelines for future research to accelerate wide adoption of AI in PM
- Published in Project Leadership and Society (part of a special issue on "Project Leadership and AI")
- Provides a principled, theory-grounded basis for matching AI tools to PM contexts, rather than ad hoc application lists
- Highlights that different PM activities require different AI approaches based on the nature of knowledge involved
- Open access, making it widely available to practitioners and researchers

## Relevance to Topic
This paper provides a critical missing piece in the AI-PM literature: a principled framework for matching AI tools to PM knowledge areas based on knowledge type. While other studies identify which PM areas are most impacted by AI, this paper explains why and which type of AI is appropriate for each. The distinction between generative AI for tacit knowledge domains and ML algorithms for data-driven domains is a practically important insight that goes beyond what most frameworks offer. Published in a PM-specific journal's special issue on AI, it represents the current state of the art in conceptual thinking about AI integration in PM.
