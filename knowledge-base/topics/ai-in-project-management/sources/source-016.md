# Artificial Intelligence and Project Management: An Empirical Investigation on the Appropriation of Generative Chatbots by Project Managers

## Summary
Published in the Journal of Innovation & Knowledge (Elsevier, Volume 9, Issue 3, July-September 2024), this empirical study investigates how project managers are adopting and adapting generative AI tools, specifically ChatGPT, for enhanced project management. The paper employs Adaptive Structuration Theory (AST) as its theoretical framework and uses Partial Least Square - Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) to analyze survey data from Italian project managers.

The study examines three key factors influencing AI tool appropriation: Innovation Attitude (the project manager's disposition toward new technologies), Peer Influence (social dynamics and colleague behavior), and Task-Technology Fit (the alignment between PM tasks and AI tool capabilities). The research confirms that all three hypothesized antecedents significantly affect how project managers appropriate AI tools. Innovation Attitude and Peer Influence positively impact both creative and "unfaithful" use of AI in project management -- meaning project managers adapt the tools beyond their designed purposes. Task-Technology Fit is crucial for effective integration, impacting both creative behavior and unfaithful appropriation.

This is one of the first empirical studies to use a rigorous theoretical framework (AST) to examine generative AI adoption specifically in the project management context, moving beyond descriptive accounts to explanatory modelling of adoption behaviors.

## Key Takeaways
- Uses Adaptive Structuration Theory (AST) as theoretical framework -- a significant theoretical contribution to the field
- Employs PLS-SEM methodology to analyze survey data from Italian project managers
- Three key factors studied: Innovation Attitude, Peer Influence, and Task-Technology Fit
- Innovation Attitude positively impacts creative and "unfaithful" use of AI (adapting tools beyond designed purposes)
- Peer Influence significantly affects adoption patterns -- social dynamics drive AI tool appropriation
- Task-Technology Fit is crucial for effective AI integration -- alignment between PM tasks and tool capabilities determines success
- Project managers are both adopting and adapting generative AI tools, not just using them as designed
- The concept of "unfaithful appropriation" captures how PMs creatively repurpose AI tools for unintended uses
- Identifies cultural and organizational context as important areas for future research
- One of the first empirical studies to apply rigorous theoretical frameworks to GenAI adoption in PM specifically

## Notable Quotes
> "The integration of generative AI tools, such as chatbots, into project management is revolutionizing the field." — Felicetti et al.

> "The study highlights the role of an innovative mindset, peer dynamics, and task compatibility in the effective use of AI tools in project management." — Felicetti et al.

## Relevance to Topic
This paper provides the kind of theoretically grounded empirical evidence that the field needs. While much of the literature on AI in PM is descriptive or speculative, this study applies a recognized social theory (AST) to explain adoption patterns, making it foundational for understanding not just what project managers do with AI, but why they adopt and adapt it. The finding that peer influence is a significant driver has practical implications for organizational change management when introducing AI tools.
