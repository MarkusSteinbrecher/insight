    text: "This is one of the most comprehensive systematic literature reviews on AI in project management, covering nearly three decades of research. Its PRISMA-based methodology, large sample size (215 papers), and cross-sectional analysis of PM processes against AI tools make it a foundational reference for understanding the academic landscape. The identification of risk management as the dominant AI application area, and the concentration on the construction sector, reveal important gaps and opportunities for broader PM domains."
