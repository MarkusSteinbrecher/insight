# Session Log — 2026-02-14

## Overview

Three connected sessions on the "Enterprise Architecture for AI" topic. Started with 3 PDF sources and ended with 30 sources, a full knowledge graph dashboard, a critical insights analysis page, and an interactive discussion skill.

## Session 1: Foundation

**What happened:**
- Ingested 3 PDF documents (source-001 to source-003) into structured source notes
- Ran `/analyze` — extracted 19 insights across claims, evidence, patterns, gaps
- Created structured YAML extractions for the 3 PDF sources (131 claims, 74 statistics, 32 concepts, etc.)
- Ran `/research` — gathered 9 web sources (source-004 to source-012)
- Created YAML extractions for web sources (source-004 to source-012)
- Built the Dashboard page with D3.js knowledge graph visualization
- Built the Sources page with tabular source listing

**Key output:**
- 12 sources with YAML extractions
- Dashboard at `/dashboard/` with 510 nodes, 2804 edges
- Sources page at `/sources/`

## Session 2: Claim Alignment + Research Expansion

**What happened:**
- Identified that 131 individual claims needed deduplication across sources
- Created `claim-alignment.yaml` with semantic clustering:
  - 27 canonical claims (consensus across sources)
  - 20 unique claims (single-source only)
  - 3 contradictions (opposing positions)
- Added "finding" as a first-class node type in the dashboard (gold/amber, larger radius)
- Added targeted research inputs to `_index.md`: 6 keywords + 13 consulting/analyst firm domains
- Ran targeted research — created 18 new sources (source-013 to source-030) from Deloitte, Forrester, Accenture, McKinsey, Gartner, The Open Group, MIT Sloan, and others

**Key output:**
- 30 total sources (12 with YAML extractions, 18 pending)
- Claim alignment with 27 canonical findings
- Dashboard updated with finding nodes

## Session 3: Critical Analysis + Insights Page

**What happened:**
- Ran 3 parallel critical analysis agents — each playing Skeptic + Practitioner roles
- Analyzed all 27 canonical claims + 3 contradictions for:
  - Platitude score (1-10)
  - Actionability score (1-10)
  - Novelty score (1-10)
  - Verdict: genuine_insight / partial_insight / important_but_obvious / platitude
  - Detailed critique, practical value, concrete action steps, bottom line
- Built the Insights page (`/insights/`) with Google-inspired clean design
- Created the `/discuss` command for interactive insight walkthrough
- Started first `/discuss EA for AI` session — covered cc-001 before pausing
- Updated CLAUDE.md with new pages, commands, and directory structures

**Critical analysis results:**
- 3 genuine insights (Knowledge Graphs for AI reasoning, Open standards/MCP/A2A, LLM unreliability without grounding)
- 10 partial insights (useful kernel buried under noise)
- 10 important but obvious (true but everyone knows this)
- 4 platitudes (pure consulting speak)
- Average scores: Platitude 5.7/10, Actionability 4.6/10, Novelty 3.6/10
- 2 of 3 contradictions are false tensions (terminological, not architectural)

**Key discussion note on cc-001:**
- User confirmed "important but obvious" verdict
- Key insight: the claim needs to specify WHAT makes architectures insufficient
- Reframed as four dimensions of insufficiency: (1) infrastructure gaps, (2) governance model, (3) non-determinism, (4) cost dynamics
- This reframing is more actionable than the original platitude

## Session 4: Data Completion

**What happened:**
- Created YAML extractions for all 18 pending sources (source-013 through source-030)
- Re-ran claim alignment across all 30 sources:
  - 34 canonical claims (up from 27 — 7 new cross-source findings)
  - 41 unique claims (up from 21 — 21 new single-source insights)
  - 5 contradictions (up from 3 — 2 new tensions)
- Regenerated dashboard.json: 1,019 nodes (up from ~510), 9,489 edges (up from ~2,804)
- Regenerated sources.json with all 30 sources (was 12)
- Created `scripts/build-sources-data.py` for reproducible sources.json generation
- Updated topic metadata: extraction_count=30, canonical_claims=34, contradictions=5
- Updated insights page subtitle to reflect 30 sources

**New canonical claims (cc-028 to cc-034):**
- cc-028: EA role must evolve from technical custodian to strategic facilitator (6 sources)
- cc-029: Event-driven architecture is foundational for agentic AI (4 sources)
- cc-030: AI requires process redesign, not just automation (4 sources)
- cc-031: AI maturity is measurable and correlates with financial performance (3 sources)
- cc-032: Regulatory compliance (EU AI Act) driving EA for AI (3 sources)
- cc-033: AI-augmented EA tooling transforming the practice (4 sources)
- cc-034: Convergence of data, AI, and operations enables real-time action (3 sources)

**New contradictions:**
- contra-004: Rigid/sequential governance vs. adaptive/principle-based for AI velocity
- contra-005: EA's primary value as governance/control vs. business value creation

**Dashboard stats (all 30 sources):**
- 303 claims, 110 statistics, 194 concepts, 170 recommendations, 110 references, 68 frameworks

## Session 5: Full-Scale Analysis Pipeline (continued from session 4)

**What happened:**
- Completed Step 1.2: Merged 4 alignment chunk files into single `claim-alignment.yaml`
  - 136 canonical claims (cc-001 to cc-136), 82 unique claims, 18 contradictions
  - All 30 sources referenced, validated with Python
- Completed Step 1.3: Critical analysis of all 136 canonical claims (4 parallel agents, 34 claims each)
  - 21 genuine insights, 55 partial insights, 45 important-but-obvious, 15 platitudes
  - Average scores: platitude 5.4, actionability 4.5, novelty 3.8
- Completed Step 1.4: Cross-source comparison (3 parallel agents)
  - 14,424-word narrative analysis across 6 sections
  - 8 thematic clusters, 4 meta-tensions, 7 key findings, 7 research gaps, 5 thought leadership angles

**Key output:**
- `extractions/claim-alignment.yaml` (3,154 lines)
- `extractions/critical-analysis-part1.yaml` through `part4.yaml`
- `extractions/cross-source-analysis.md` (748 lines)

## Session 6: Interactive Discussion

**What happened:**
- Started Step 2.1: `/discuss EA for AI` — top 10 most actionable findings
- Discussed 8 findings with user, capturing verdicts and practitioner calibration:
  - cc-104 (TOGAF too slow): Keep — but "TOGAF isn't widely used"; governance speed matters regardless of framework
  - cc-004 (right-size models): Keep — multi-model already common in sophisticated orgs
  - cc-016 (data is the moat): Keep — commoditization angle is novel enough
  - cc-026 (MCP/A2A protocols): Keep — recommend the pattern (protocol abstraction), not specific protocols
  - cc-031 (redesign processes): Keep — confirms most orgs are "bolting on", not redesigning
  - cc-089 (model size ≠ value): Merge with cc-004 — same fundamental insight
  - cc-098 (AI-augmented governance): Keep — but "mostly aspirational", EA tooling not mature enough
  - cc-100 (process first): Keep — process understanding must precede AI automation
- Saved discussion to `discussion/discussion-2026-02-14.yaml`

**Key user calibration:**
- TOGAF isn't widely used formally — reframe as governance speed, not framework-specific
- AI-augmented EA governance is aspirational, not achievable today for most orgs
- Process mining prerequisite is confirmed from experience

## Session 7: Synthesis + Infrastructure

**What happened:**
- Completed Step 2.2: Created `synthesis.md` (6,885 words, 3 parallel agents)
  - Section 1: Executive Summary — thesis, 7 key findings, practitioner calibration
  - Section 2: Research Landscape — corpus composition, quality distribution, blind spots
  - Section 3: The Seven Signals — each finding with practitioner implications and bottom lines
  - Section 4: Five Tensions Worth Debating — irreconcilable contradictions requiring a stance
  - Section 5: Thought Leadership Positions — 5 original positions with concrete output proposals
  - Section 6: Research Agenda + Content Roadmap — 7 gaps, 7 proposed content pieces
- Updated CLAUDE.md: Phase 3 now uses `/conclude` (not `/synthesize`) — "So What?" framing
- Created `sources/_overview.md` — full source table with metadata, types, institutions
- Created `sources-queue.yaml` — mechanism for users to add web sources for processing
- Updated `_index.md`: status=synthesized, phase=2, current_step=3.1
- Started step 3.1 analysis (reader perspective) but paused at user's request

**Content roadmap from synthesis (7 proposed pieces):**
1. "Governance Principles for AI: The Post-Framework Playbook" (POV, 3-4K words)
2. "The Knowledge Graph Imperative" (Blog, 1.5-2K words)
3. "Agent Service Management: An ITIL for the Silicon Workforce" (POV, 4-5K words)
4. "The Governance Paradox" (LinkedIn series + Executive brief)
5. "Right-Size Your AI" (Blog, 1.2-1.5K words)
6. "Process Redesign for Agents: Stop Paving the Cow Path" (Blog, 1.5-2K words)
7. "The Inter-Agent Communication Bet" (POV, 3-4K words)

## Pending Work

### Next Step
1. **Execute Step 3.1 (`/conclude`)** — Reader perspective analysis: what's actionable, what challenges will readers face, what's missing for them to act

### Then
2. **Step 3.2** — Prioritized, sequenced recommendations for the target audience
3. **Step 3.3** — Thought leadership angles refined with user input

### Content Creation (after Phase 3)
4. **Draft content pieces** from the roadmap — start with highest-impact pieces
5. **Regenerate Hugo site data** — dashboard.json, insights.json, sources.json with updated analysis

## Architecture Decisions Made

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| YAML for extractions, JSON for site data | YAML is human-readable for research; JSON is efficient for JS consumption |
| Separate claim alignment from per-source extractions | Claims need cross-source deduplication that per-source files can't provide |
| Critical analysis as YAML, not markdown | Structured scores enable filtering/sorting on the Insights page |
| Google-inspired design for Insights page | Clean, modern aesthetic with emphasis on readability and whitespace |
| `/discuss` as interactive command, not automated | User's real-world perspective is the most valuable input for content quality |
| Session logs in `knowledge-base/sessions/` | Per-day files enable resuming work across sessions |
