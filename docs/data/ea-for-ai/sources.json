      "body_html": "<h2>Summary</h2>\n<p>This paper presents a foundational framework for integrating Agentic AI and Generative AI into enterprise architecture, aiming to achieve scalable, secure, and operationally resilient systems. The author argues that traditional enterprise architectures -- relying on static, rule-based systems and centralized AI -- are insufficient for the demands of modern digital transformation. The proposed model introduces autonomous, communicative, goal-driven agents that collaborate through Agent-to-Agent (A2A) communication protocols and intent-based coordination via the Agent Communication Protocol (ACP), integrated with LLM-powered reasoning engines.</p>\n<p>The framework is built on three interlocking pillars: (1) AI-driven security with autonomous defense agents that use generative AI for threat simulation and zero-trust enforcement; (2) performance optimization through distributed agent orchestration with micro-agents, event-driven communication (Kafka, EventBridge), and vectorized memory (pgvector, Pinecone); and (3) operational resilience through self-healing agent behaviors, automated failover, and federated learning across hybrid cloud-edge environments. The architecture also incorporates a Model Context Protocol (MCP) interface connecting agents to a centralized AI Gateway, enabling them to invoke foundation models and maintain long-term memory.</p>\n<p>The paper includes a comparative analysis showing the proposed model achieves 96.3% threat detection accuracy (vs. 85.7% for traditional models), sub-200ms response times (vs. 1.2s), and a 2.1% false positive rate (vs. 5.4%). It also presents three industry case studies (financial services, healthcare, manufacturing) and argues that legacy architecture methodologies like TOGAF and ITIL are insufficient for modern agentic AI environments. The work calls for new governance frameworks, explainable AI, and standards for cross-agent communication.</p>\n<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Agentic AI extends generative AI from passive models to autonomous enterprise agents</strong>: The paper frames agentic AI as the next evolution beyond generative AI, where autonomous agents don't just generate content but plan, reason, coordinate, and execute complex enterprise tasks through structured inter-agent protocols (A2A, ACP, MCP).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Three-pillar architecture for enterprise AI</strong>: The proposed framework rests on three pillars -- AI-driven security (autonomous defense agents, GAN-based threat simulation, zero-trust), scalable performance optimization (micro-agents, event-driven architectures, hardware acceleration), and operational resilience (self-healing agents, automated failover, federated learning).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Legacy EA frameworks are insufficient for AI-native systems</strong>: The paper explicitly argues that TOGAF, ITIL, and siloed AI integration models fail to account for continuous learning cycles, distributed agentic behaviors, and dynamic performance characteristics that define modern enterprise AI, creating a need for new architectural paradigms.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Agent-to-Agent (A2A) communication is the core coordination mechanism</strong>: The architecture depends on structured A2A protocols for agents to exchange context, validate anomalies, escalate incidents, and trigger automated actions -- enabling decentralized cognition rather than centralized automation.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Federated learning enables privacy-preserving multi-agent collaboration</strong>: Edge-resident agents (in hospitals, branches, remote devices) update shared models locally while exchanging only weights or gradients, preserving data privacy and supporting compliance with GDPR, HIPAA, and similar regulations.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Composable, event-driven architecture is the operational backbone</strong>: The framework uses event-driven platforms (Kafka, AWS EventBridge), vector databases for persistent memory, and RAG (retrieval-augmented generation) to create a composable infrastructure where agents can be modularly deployed and scaled across domains.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Notable Quotes</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"This shift from traditional, centralized AI to distributed, agentic ecosystems marks a foundational evolution in how enterprises design scalable and secure systems.\" (p. 1)</p>\n<p>\"This transition from generative to agentic AI represents a structural redefinition of enterprise systems: from centralized automation to decentralized cognition.\" (p. 2)</p>\n<p>\"Legacy architecture methodologies such as TOGAF, ITIL, or siloed AI integration models fail to account for the continuous learning cycles, distributed agentic behaviors, and dynamic performance characteristics that define modern enterprise AI.\" (p. 13)</p>\n<p>\"Trust in AI systems -- encompassing fairness, security, privacy, and regulatory alignment -- is not optional.

      "body_html": "<h2>Summary</h2>\n<p>This paper proposes the Agentic AI-enabled Business Modelling Architecture (ABMA), a modular, AI-driven system designed to automate the generation of Business Architecture (BA) artefacts -- specifically business capability models (BCMs). The authors argue that current BA methods are largely manual, static, and time-consuming, producing artefacts that quickly become outdated in dynamic business environments. While LLMs have shown promise in generating BA artefacts through prompting techniques, they are prone to hallucination and lack semantic grounding. The ABMA addresses these limitations by integrating multi-agent orchestration (using Microsoft's AutoGen 0.2 framework) with an Enterprise Knowledge Graph (EKG) hosted on Stardog to provide semantic validation and organisational context.</p>\n<p>The system architecture comprises five layers: user interaction, context extraction, orchestration, processing, and knowledge. Specialized agents (entity agent, capability agent, value stream agent, value map agent, mapping agent) handle different aspects of BA artefact generation. The paper demonstrates the approach through two configurations: one using LLM-only agents with Tree-of-Thought (ToT) prompting, and a second integrating the Capsifi BA ontology and EKG for semantic validation. The EKG-enhanced configuration showed improved semantic alignment of generated capabilities, though matching was limited to Level 1 capabilities in the current prototype.</p>\n<p>This is a work-in-progress research project conducted in partnership with Capsifi Pvt. Ltd. (an industry BA modelling platform) and the University of Technology Sydney, using Design Science Research methodology. The authors plan to extend the system to additional BA artefact types and deeper capability hierarchy levels, with the goal of producing a practitioner-ready tool for automated, context-aware BA modelling.</p>\n<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Traditional Business Architecture methods produce static artefacts that become outdated quickly; agentic AI offers a path to dynamic, automated BA artefact generation that can keep pace with evolving business environments.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Integrating Enterprise Knowledge Graphs (EKGs) with LLM-based agents significantly improves the semantic accuracy and organisational relevance of generated BA artefacts, compared to using LLMs with prompt engineering alone.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The Tree-of-Thought (ToT) prompting technique improves LLM reasoning for capability map generation by allowing exploration of multiple solution paths in parallel, but without external knowledge grounding, the outputs remain semantically unverified.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The proposed ABMA architecture is modular and extensible -- specialized agents can be added for different BA artefact types (capability maps, value stream maps, application portfolios), each interacting with LLMs and validated against domain ontologies and EKGs.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In the EKG-enhanced configuration, only Level 1 capabilities (\"Claims Management\") matched the enterprise knowledge graph, revealing a current limitation: deeper capability hierarchies (Levels 2-5) generated by the LLM do not yet align with existing organisational ontologies.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The research demonstrates a human-in-the-loop design where users provide natural language queries and receive structured BA artefacts with feedback and refinement capabilities, positioning AI as a \"copilot\" rather than a fully autonomous system.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Notable Quotes</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Current methods in BA artefact generation and maintenance are largely manual, static, and time-consuming, which limits their effectiveness in dynamic and complex decision-making environments.\" (p. 1)</p>\n<p>\"Agentic AI offers an alternative approach to LLM-based BA modelling, due to its ability to make autonomous decisions, adapt through learning, and process data in real-time.\" (p. 1)</p>\n<p>\"This hybrid approach combines the generative strength of the LLM with the semantic control of structured enterprise knowledge, resulting in accurate and context-aware BA modelling, which leads to increased trust in the generated model.\" (p. 4)</p>\n<p>\"Configuration 1 performed better at creative, unconstrained generation of the capability map, but was semantically unverified.

      "body_html": "<h2>Summary</h2>\n<p>This comprehensive report by Economist Impact, commissioned by Databricks, combines a global survey of 1,100 respondents (715 technical executives and 385 data/AI technologists) across 19 countries and eight industries with interviews from 28 C-suite executives. It provides a thorough assessment of enterprise AI implementation, covering adoption patterns, ROI strategies, infrastructure challenges, model selection, and governance frameworks. The report spans data engineering, data science, and enterprise architecture perspectives.</p>\n<p>The central thesis is that while AI adoption is widespread (85% of organisations are using GenAI in at least one business function), most enterprises are unprepared for enterprise-wide deployment. Only 22% say their current architecture can support AI workloads without modifications, and only 37% of executives believe their GenAI applications are production-ready. The report identifies a critical need for infrastructure modernisation (\"fixing the plumbing\"), robust data governance, and a shift from internal productivity-focused use cases to external, revenue-generating applications.</p>\n<p>The report covers five major themes: (1) AI's \"unlock moment\" with democratisation via natural language interfaces; (2) rewards and returns, where productivity gains are early wins but long-term value comes from revenue growth and business model innovation; (3) the infrastructure refit needed to support AI at scale, including data lakehouses and real-time processing; (4) finding competitive edge through mixing proprietary data with open- and closed-source models; and (5) guardrails and governance, including Centres of Excellence as \"forcing functions\" for coordination.</p>\n<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Enterprise architectures are woefully unprepared for AI</strong>: Only 22% of organisations have architectures fully capable of supporting AI workloads, and 48% of data engineers spend most of their time resolving data source connections -- the equivalent of \"Victorian-era plumbing\" in a modern building.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>GenAI adoption is near-universal but production-readiness lags</strong>: 85% of organisations are actively using GenAI, reaching 97% among companies with revenue over US$10bn, yet only 37% of executives (and just 29% of practitioners) believe their GenAI applications are production-ready.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Proprietary data is the competitive differentiator</strong>: Two-thirds of organisations see significant potential in integrating GenAI models with their own data. As foundation models commoditise, the \"edge\" comes from proprietary data and domain expertise, not the models themselves.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>ROI requires patience and strategic framing</strong>: Revenue growth has been the least effective metric for justifying AI investment to date (only 19% of respondents). Leaders argue AI returns require a 3+ year timeline and should be measured through business model innovation, market positioning, and customer experience, not just productivity.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Infrastructure needs an overhaul</strong>: Real-time data processing (47%), robust data pipelines (42%), and security (39%) are the top architecture capability gaps. Companies are shifting to multi-cloud, data lakehouses, and unified platforms to support AI workloads.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Centres of Excellence are emerging as governance enablers</strong>: COEs serve as both brakes and accelerators -- enforcing guardrails while acting as \"forcing functions\" for AI delivery across the enterprise, bringing together multidisciplinary teams.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>The shift from internal to external AI use cases is underway</strong>: By 2027, 99% of executives expect GenAI adoption across both internal and external use cases. External use cases are already showing outsized ROI compared to investment levels.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Notable Quotes</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"You can have all the AI in the world, but if it's on a shaky data foundation, then it's not going to bring you any value.\" -- Carol Clements, chief digital and technology officer, JetBlue (p. 31)</p>\n<p>\"GenAI is going to be a commodity embedded in everything, similarly to the internet, and the value will be in the business problems it helps solve.\" -- Darrin Vohs, global chief information officer, Molson Coors (p. 11)</p>\n<p>\"There is no such thing as a technology strategy. There's only a business strategy that technology supports.\" -- Melissa Pint, chief digital information officer, Frontier (p. 24)</p>\n<p>\"Most of the value that you see on AI is buried in the bottom. The top is immediate benefits like productivity, but that's the starting point. You've not gone into your core value chain, that's when you go beneath the iceberg. That is where your proprietary data is.\" -- Senthil Ramani, global lead, data and AI, Accenture (p. 37)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Data Points</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>85% of organisations are actively using GenAI in at least one business function; 97% among companies with revenue over US$10bn</li>\n<li>Only 22% of organisations say their current architecture can support AI workloads without modifications</li>\n<li>Only 37% of executives believe their GenAI applications are production-ready (29% among practitioners)</li>\n<li>48% of data engineers spend most of their time resolving data source connections</li>\n<li>73% of respondents say GenAI is critical to their long-term strategic goals; only 18% say AI is overhyped</li>\n<li>58% of data scientists augment LLMs with proprietary data through RAG; 45% use LLMs without RAG</li>\n<li>97% of enterprise architects predict non-technical staff will use natural language to interact with complex datasets within 3 years</li>\n<li>40% of respondents say their organisation's AI safety and compliance processes are insufficient</li>\n<li>53% of enterprise architects cite data privacy and security breaches as the biggest risk of AI expansion</li>\n<li>47% of enterprise architects identify real-time data processing as the most significant architecture gap</li>\n<li>75% of organisations employ both open- and closed-source models; 89% will do so by 2027</li>\n<li>Only 1 in 6 firms are confident in their ability to attract enough AI talent</li>\n<li>Revenue growth cited by only 19% as having significantly contributed to the AI investment case</li>\n<li>US$1trn in expected capital expenditure coming for AI infrastructure (data centres, chips, energy)</li>\n<li>Flo Health: 24% boost in data engineering efficiency from AI assistants</li>\n<li>Repsol: up to 30% productivity improvement from GenAI coding experiment with 200 coders</li>\n<li>Unilever: trained nearly 20,000 people in GenAI use</li>\n<li>US DoD: processed over 10 million payment records, identifying US$12.7bn in improper payments since 2020</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Methodology / Framework</h2>\n<p>The report is based on:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Global Survey</strong>: 1,100 respondents (715 technical executives + 385 data/AI technologists) across 19 countries, 8 industries, fielded July-August 2024.

Companies need to get better at constant road mapping and iteration because the era of 'build it once and forget it' is over.\" \u2014 Tracey Franklin, Chief People and Digital Technology Officer, Moderna</p>\n<p>\"Modernization is not about technology for technology's sake; it's about addressing fundamental business problems like costs, go-to-market issues, and so on.\" \u2014 Alan Davidson, CIO, Broadcom</p>\n<p>\"For global organizations, one size rarely fits all. Our approach has been to build a modular architecture and a set of guiding core principles supported by an agile team able to operate at speed while localizing as needed.\" \u2014 Neeraj Tolmare, SVP and CIO, The Coca-Cola Company</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Relevance to Topic</h2>\n<p>This report is highly relevant as it documents the current state of enterprise architecture transformation driven by AI, with extensive survey data quantifying the shift. It connects EA directly to organizational design, arguing that architecture is no longer just a technical discipline but one that shapes how entire organizations are structured and governed. The modularity and observability imperatives provide concrete architectural principles for the EA for AI topic, and the survey data on AI architect role growth directly supports the case for a new EA paradigm.</p>"

They diagnose the core EA paradox: architects must guide the evolution of vast, dynamic enterprises using tools and processes that are static, fragmented, and slow. The EA repository, intended as the source of truth, too often becomes a \"dusty attic of outdated diagrams.\"</p>\n<p>Their solution is the operationalization of architecture via closed feedback loops powered by AI agents, LLMs, retrieval-augmented generation, vector databases, and dynamic graph-based systems. In this model, every update from CI/CD pipelines, every cloud API change, and every policy deviation becomes a signal fed into a living architecture graph. Specialized agents \u2014 harvesting agents, dependency agents, lifecycle-aware agents, conformance agents, and security/cost agents \u2014 continuously process these signals and notify architects at or before decision points.</p>\n<p>The article systematically addresses how AI-augmented EA solves classic EA failures: intelligent recommenders provide context and rationale; diagram recognition agents convert hand-drawn schematics into structured models; pattern recognition agents detect anti-patterns; chatbots democratize architecture insight; and generative agents propose transition roadmaps based on actual feasibility.

The detailed taxonomy of AI agent types for architecture (harvesting, dependency, lifecycle, conformance, security/cost) provides a concrete reference architecture for AI-augmented EA. The \"Architecture Operating System\" concept and the shift from open-loop to closed-loop governance represent foundational ideas for rethinking EA in the AI era.</p>"

The core finding is that the challenge is not primarily technological but operational: enterprises are trying to automate existing processes designed for humans rather than redesigning them for AI-first operations. HPE's CFO illustrates the successful approach: selecting end-to-end processes for true transformation rather than solving single pain points.</p>\n<p>The report reveals a significant governance gap. While close to three-quarters of companies plan to deploy agentic AI within two years, only one in five has a mature governance model. This gap is compounded by architectural challenges -- traditional enterprise systems were not designed for agentic interactions, and most agents still rely on APIs and conventional data pipelines that limit their autonomous capabilities. The report recommends agent-first process redesign, multiagent orchestration using emerging protocols, and treating agents as a silicon-based workforce requiring specialized management frameworks.</p>\n<p>Deloitte also identifies infrastructure strategy as critical. Rather than binary cloud-versus-on-premises thinking, leading organizations are moving to strategic three-tier hybrid architectures. The report notes that 86% of chief human resources officers see integrating digital labor as central to their role, with early models showing humans acting as \"agent bosses\" working alongside agents. Gartner predicts 40% of enterprise applications will embed AI agents by end of 2026, up from less than 5% in 2025.</p>\n<h2>Notable Quotes</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The challenge isn't technology, it's that enterprises are trying to automate existing processes designed for humans rather than redesigning them for AI-first operations.\"</p>\n<p>\"Only 21% of companies report having a mature model for agent governance.\"</p>\n<p>\"86% of chief human resources officers see integrating digital labor as central to their role.\"</p>\n<p>\"40% of agentic projects will fail because organizations are automating broken processes instead of redesigning operations.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Relevance to Topic</h2>\n<p>This is one of the most significant industry analyst reports on the intersection of agentic AI and enterprise architecture. It provides hard data on the maturity gap, governance deficit, and architectural readiness challenges that directly inform the EA for AI research topic. The concept of \"silicon-based workforce\" and the need for specialized agent management frameworks represent a paradigm shift that enterprise architecture must accommodate. The three-tier hybrid architecture recommendation and the emphasis on process redesign over automation offer actionable architectural guidance.</p>"

The paper proposes a reference architecture that organizes governance responsibilities into a twelve-domain taxonomy and defines bounded agent families that mediate between security tools and organizational policy.</p>\n<p>The architecture treats enterprise AI deployments as \"AI estates\" -- socio-technical systems spanning models, agents, data pipelines, security tooling, human workflows, and hyperscale infrastructure. PBSAI assumes baseline enterprise security capabilities and encodes key systems security techniques including analytic monitoring, coordinated defense, and adaptive response.

The central argument is that agentic AI -- autonomous systems capable of reasoning, planning, and executing multi-step tasks across the enterprise -- requires a fundamental rethinking of enterprise architecture, not incremental API additions.</p>\n<p>The article identifies event-driven architecture as the foundational shift required. Traditional synchronous, tightly coupled integration patterns (typical REST API calls to monolithic ERP and CRM systems) create bottlenecks when agents need to operate autonomously. Instead, organizations should adopt asynchronous, event-driven architectures where agents interact with a message bus (like Apache Kafka or Amazon EventBridge) rather than making direct, blocking calls to legacy databases. This allows for long-running tasks where agents can trigger actions and resume when events are published back.</p>\n<p>A key architectural concept introduced is the \"agent tier\" -- a new layer in the enterprise architecture comprising cognitive AI for reasoning capabilities and autonomous orchestration systems that trigger appropriate applications. This represents a significant evolution of traditional enterprise architecture layering models, adding an intelligent orchestration layer between business processes and underlying systems.</p>\n<h2>Notable Quotes</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"If 2025 was about the brain (the LLM), 2026 must be about the nervous system.\"</p>\n<p>\"The traditional approach to integrating new tools -- a simple REST API call to a monolithic system like your ERP or CRM -- is a bottleneck for autonomous agents.\"</p>\n<p>\"An event-driven architecture, typically built on a message broker like Kafka, decouples agents from one another and from your core systems.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Relevance to Topic</h2>\n<p>This article provides concrete, actionable architectural guidance for the technology architecture domain of EA for AI. The concept of an \"agent tier\" as a new enterprise architecture layer directly extends traditional EA layering models (like TOGAF's architecture domains). The emphasis on event-driven architecture as a prerequisite for agentic AI deployment offers a specific technical pattern that enterprise architects can adopt. The \"brain vs. nervous system\" framing effectively communicates that AI infrastructure is as important as AI models themselves.</p>"

The article argues that gen AI is not merely an incremental improvement but will fundamentally restructure how technology organizations operate, from team composition and talent management to IT architecture and cost structures.</p>\n<p>The most architecturally significant shift is the move from traditional application-centric IT architectures to multiagent architectures.

Factory patterns apply to standardized, repeatable AI workflows that can be scaled and optimized for cost-efficiency. Artisan patterns apply to creative, high-judgment work that requires human expertise augmented by AI. The key leadership challenge is regularly reviewing and fine-tuning the balance between these patterns, including identifying opportunities for autonomous agents within workflows and ways to increase artisan team productivity.</p>\n<p>The article tempers expectations by noting that full adoption is likely a decade away, emphasizing that success requires strategic design, not just technology deployment.</p>\n<h2>Notable Quotes</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"IT architectures are expected to be significantly different, evolving from a traditional application-focused approach to new multiagent architectures where tech leaders oversee hundreds or thousands of distinct gen AI agents.\"</p>\n<p>\"Modular frameworks that guide the development of common reusable gen AI agents and tools are important to ensure agents can be easily modified and assembled, like LEGOs, for use in different agentic workflows.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Relevance to Topic</h2>\n<p>This McKinsey article provides a strategic-level perspective on how enterprise technology architecture must evolve for AI, making it essential to the EA for AI topic.

They define EA broadly as the holistic design of people, processes, and technology \u2014 not just IT systems \u2014 to execute digitally inspired strategic goals. Every negative customer interaction via app, website, phone, or service provider \"exposes your architectural inadequacies.\"</p>\n<p>The article establishes three core principles for EA-driven organizational redesign. First, componentization: breaking key business outcomes (products, customer experiences, core processes) into reusable components with clear accountability, where each component is a living asset continuously improved by a dedicated team. Second, empowerment: cross-functional teams (product owners, developers, user designers, data scientists, legal, finance) are given autonomy to define and meet their goals. Third, strategy influence: as component teams address strategic objectives, they simultaneously reformulate strategy based on continuous learning about customer needs and technology capabilities.</p>\n<p>The CarMax case study illustrates the evolutionary approach: starting with three product teams in 2015 to address urgent online experience needs, then gradually expanding to 30+ empowered teams covering the full omnichannel business model. This demonstrates that EA transformation is incremental and value-generating at each step, not a big-bang redesign.</p>\n<h2>Notable Quotes</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"We define enterprise architecture as the holistic design of people, processes, and technology to execute digitally inspired strategic goals.\"</p>\n<p>\"Every negative customer interaction via a company app, website, telephone call, or service provider exposes your architectural inadequacies.\"</p>\n<p>\"When companies fund teams rather than strategic initiatives or systems development projects, those groups can respond almost instantaneously to what Spotify refers to as the company's 'bets.'\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Relevance to Topic</h2>\n<p>While this article predates the current AI wave (published August 2020), it provides essential foundational context for the EA for AI topic. The definition of EA as encompassing people, processes, and technology \u2014 not just IT systems \u2014 is particularly relevant as AI transforms all three dimensions simultaneously. The componentization principle directly maps to the modular, composable architectures that AI implementations require. The cross-functional team model anticipates the human-AI collaboration patterns emerging in AI-native organizations. Understanding these EA fundamentals is necessary to appreciate how profoundly AI is reshaping the discipline.</p>"

A striking finding is the expectation gap between CEOs and CIOs on AI's value: over 80% of CEOs see AI driving top-line growth, while only 3% of CIOs agree \u2014 with technology leaders focused on productivity gains instead. This disconnect creates a strategic challenge that EA must help bridge.</p>\n<p>Gartner prescribes three imperatives for EA leaders. First, develop a new EA operating model suited to federated business designs \u2014 organizations where decision-making is distributed rather than centralized. Second, modernize and rationalize technology portfolios by reducing technical debt and embracing composable architectures that enable flexibility and reuse. Third, expand EA team skills beyond traditional technology and process competencies to include financial modeling, analysis, and AI capabilities such as data-driven architectures, data modeling, and AI solution development.</p>\n<p>A significant call-to-action is the creation of a dedicated AI Architect role \u2014 Gartner sees this as a demand-driven necessity, not a nice-to-have. The broader vision is that EA teams must evolve from technical custodians to strategic business partners, with half expected to rebrand accordingly by 2028. Gartner's prediction that 40% of enterprise apps will integrate task-specific AI agents by end of 2026 underscores the urgency of these architectural transformations.</p>\n<h2>Notable Quotes</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"More than 80% of CEOs expect AI to contribute to top-line growth in 2025, whereas only 3% of CIOs expect the same.\"</p>\n<p>\"The emergence of AI in Enterprise Architecture demands the creation of an AI Architect role.\"</p>\n<p>\"Heads of enterprise architecture must guide tech investments, evolve models for innovation, and embrace AI for future-ready architecture.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Relevance to Topic</h2>\n<p>Gartner's analysis is highly relevant as it frames EA for AI within the broader strategic context of economic and geopolitical uncertainty. The CEO-CIO expectation gap on AI value is a crucial insight for EA practitioners trying to bridge business strategy and technology implementation. The three imperatives (new operating model, composable architectures, expanded skills) provide a practical roadmap for EA transformation. The call for a dedicated AI Architect role validates the hypothesis that AI requires new specialized architectural expertise, and the prediction on AI agent adoption provides a concrete timeline for architectural readiness.</p>"

Unlike previous automation waves addressing discrete steps, AI agents can reason, coordinate, and execute complex multistep workflows requiring human judgment. The report identifies a two-tier orchestration architecture: higher-level orchestrator agents manage workflows while task agents execute individual steps.</p>\n<p>Seven architectural imperatives: (1) Modernize core platforms \u2014 convert batch-based systems to API-accessible, real-time architectures; (2) Ensure interoperability \u2014 adopt standards like Model Context Protocol (MCP) to break silos; (3) Distribute accountability \u2014 central platform teams manage infrastructure while business domains handle assembly and monitoring; (4) Scale data access \u2014 build ingestion pipelines for unstructured sources; (5) Update governance and controls \u2014 real-time explainability, behavioral observability, adaptive security; (6) Shift the engineering paradigm \u2014 evolve DevOps for agent lifecycles; (7) Reimagine the agent experience \u2014 position agents as primary interaction channels.</p>\n<p>Investment framework: 5-10% of technology spending in the near term (3-5 years) toward foundational capabilities; long-term up to 50% could support enterprise-wide agents, though efficiency gains offset costs.

      "body_html": "<h2>Summary</h2>\n<p>Ardoq's white paper positions prompt engineering as a core competency for enterprise architects in the AI era. The 32-page playbook argues that EAs work differently from developers or marketers \u2014 they navigate ambiguity, trade-offs, and questions without single right answers \u2014 and therefore need architecture-specific prompting techniques rather than generic AI guidance.</p>\n<p>The paper introduces five prompting principles for EAs: ground prompts in context (business domain, scope, constraints), be explicit about desired output format, prompt for reasoning and trade-offs rather than single answers, treat prompting as iterative dialogue rather than one-off transactions, and retain final human judgment. It then provides 18 ready-to-use prompt templates across six EA use cases: application rationalization, business capability mapping, IT cost and value analysis, technology risk and compliance assessment, M&amp;A integration and due diligence, and cloud transformation planning.</p>\n<p>A recurring theme is the importance of grounding AI prompts in real, live architecture data rather than relying on the AI's general knowledge. Ardoq promotes its Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration as a mechanism for providing AI assistants with direct, secure, read-only access to live architecture models \u2014 enabling queries like \"What's the downstream impact of removing Salesforce?\" grounded in actual dependency data. The paper frames this as the emergence of a \"zero-click world\" where stakeholders (not just architects) will expect instant, AI-powered answers to architectural questions.</p>\n<p>The final sections cover advanced techniques (step decomposition, context augmentation, self-verification, tone adjustment), organizational guidance for building an AI-enabled EA practice (upskilling, workflow integration, governance, success metrics, sharing culture), and a forward-looking perspective on the evolving role of enterprise architects \u2014 from documentation custodians to AI coaches who curate prompt libraries, fine-tune models with company data, and validate AI-generated architectural recommendations.</p>\n<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Prompt engineering is becoming a core skill for enterprise architects, distinct from developer or marketing prompting</li>\n<li>EAs should ground prompts in real organizational data (portfolios, capability models, cost data) rather than relying on AI general knowledge</li>\n<li>Five prompting principles: context grounding, explicit output formats, reasoning over answers, iterative dialogue, human judgment retained</li>\n<li>18 prompt templates across 6 EA use cases: rationalization, capability mapping, cost analysis, risk/compliance, M&amp;A, cloud transformation</li>\n<li>MCP (Model Context Protocol) enables AI assistants to query live architecture data directly, producing grounded rather than hallucinated recommendations</li>\n<li>The \"zero-click world\" means stakeholders will expect instant AI-powered architectural insights \u2014 EAs who master prompting make their expertise accessible enterprise-wide</li>\n<li>AI should be treated as a \"thinking partner\" and iterative dialogue, not a one-off transaction or oracle</li>\n<li>Advanced prompting techniques: break into steps, add extra context (documents, data), ask AI to self-check assumptions, adjust tone for audience</li>\n<li>Building an AI-enabled EA practice requires: team upskilling, workflow integration, governance/privacy guardrails, success tracking, sharing culture</li>\n<li>Future EA roles include: prompt library curation, model fine-tuning with company data, AI coaching, validating AI-generated architecture recommendations</li>\n<li>Prompting will evolve from text queries to designing AI workflows and prompt chains</li>\n<li>Standards like MCP will spread, making it easier for EA tools to connect with AI without manual data preparation</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Notable Quotes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\"Where developers want code, architects want clarity. Many use AI to generate content, but architects use it to reason through complexity.\"</li>\n<li>\"We are entering a 'zero-click' world where leaders expect instant answers, not endless slide decks.\"</li>\n<li>\"Prompting is now a core skill. EAs who master conversational AI can make their expertise accessible across the enterprise.\"</li>\n<li>\"The right prompt turns AI from a novelty into an earnest intern.\"</li>\n<li>\"Think of the AI as a junior analyst \u2014 you will still need to double-check its work.\"</li>\n<li>\"AI isn't perfect, but you can prompt it to find gaps or errors in its own answers.\"</li>\n<li>\"In the near future, AI agents will work alongside us. Imagine a chatbot that says: 'I found two apps doing the same thing. Want me to draft a rationalization plan?'\"</li>\n<li>\"Invest in skills, bake it into your process, keep it safe, measure the impact, and share what works.\"</li>\n</ul>"
