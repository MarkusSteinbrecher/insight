The reasoning is straightforward: if AI absorbs administrative work, the remaining human work is disproportionately relational and strategic. What the claim does not address is how organizations should operationalize this shift. Most PM training programs, certification bodies, and performance evaluation systems still weight technical and process competencies heavily. The claim identifies the direction of change without addressing the institutional mechanisms that would need to change to support it. It also does not acknowledge that some PMs entered the profession precisely because of their strength in structured, analytical work and may not have aptitude or interest in a primarily relational role.",
