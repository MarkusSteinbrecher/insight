# Content Validation Checklist

## 1. Accuracy

- [ ] All factual claims are backed by sources in the knowledge base
- [ ] Data points and statistics are current (within 18 months unless historical)
- [ ] No misrepresentation of source material (quotes in context, findings not cherry-picked)
- [ ] Technical terminology used correctly
- [ ] Source URLs are valid and accessible
- [ ] Attribution is complete — no uncredited ideas or data

## 2. Argumentation

- [ ] Clear, specific thesis or central argument
- [ ] Logical flow from premise to conclusion
- [ ] Key counterarguments acknowledged and addressed
- [ ] Claims are proportional to evidence (no overclaiming)
- [ ] Distinction between established facts, analysis, and speculation is clear
- [ ] The "so what" is explicit — implications are stated, not left for the reader to infer

## 3. Originality

- [ ] Offers non-obvious insight (not just a summary of existing content)
- [ ] Adds to the conversation rather than repeating it
- [ ] Unique angle, synthesis, or perspective is identifiable
- [ ] Not duplicative of existing content on the site
- [ ] Would an informed reader learn something new?

## 4. Quality

- [ ] Clear, concise writing — no unnecessary jargon or filler
- [ ] Appropriate for target audience (not too basic, not too niche)
- [ ] Consistent tone throughout
- [ ] Proper grammar, spelling, and punctuation
- [ ] Effective use of structure (headings, paragraphs, lists)
- [ ] Strong opening that hooks the reader
- [ ] Strong closing that reinforces the message

## 5. Publishing Readiness

- [ ] Title is compelling and under 60 characters
- [ ] Summary/meta description is under 160 characters
- [ ] Appropriate tags assigned
- [ ] Topic taxonomy correctly applied
- [ ] Headings use proper hierarchy (H2, H3 — no skipping levels)
- [ ] All links functional
- [ ] Images have alt text (if any)
- [ ] Frontmatter complete (title, date, type, topic, tags, summary)
- [ ] Draft status set appropriately
