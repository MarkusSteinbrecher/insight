# Blog Post Template

**Target length**: 1200-2000 words
**Citation style**: Inline hyperlinks
**Tone**: Conversational expert — authoritative but approachable

## Frontmatter

```yaml

type: blog
topic: topic-slug
tags: []
summary: ""
author: ""
---
```

## Structure

### Hook (100-150 words)
Open with a compelling observation, surprising data point, or provocative question. Ground the reader in why this matters right now.

### Context (150-250 words)
Set the stage. What's the current state of this topic? What do most people assume? Brief background that makes the rest of the post accessible.

### Core Insight (400-600 words)
The main argument or insight. This is the "meat" — what you uniquely see that others might miss. Support with evidence from sources. Use subheadings if the insight has multiple facets.

### Evidence & Examples (200-400 words)
Concrete examples, case studies, or data that support the core insight. Link to sources inline.

### Implications (200-300 words)
So what? What does this mean for the reader? How should they think differently? What should they do?

### Closing (50-100 words)
Strong finish — a memorable line, a call to action, or an open question that invites discussion.
