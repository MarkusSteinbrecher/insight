## Structure

### Title
Clear, specific title that signals the topic and angle.

### Bottom Line Up Front (2-3 sentences)
The single most important thing the reader needs to know. Lead with the conclusion or recommendation.

### Situation (1 paragraph)
What's happening? Key facts, data, and context. No background the reader already knows.

### Analysis (2-3 paragraphs)
Your assessment. What does the data tell us? What are the options? What are the trade-offs? Keep it analytical, not descriptive.

### Recommendation (1 paragraph)
Specific, actionable recommendation. What should we do and why? Include timeline if relevant.

### Key Risks (3-5 bullets)
What could go wrong? What assumptions are we making?

### Footnotes
Abbreviated source citations.

## Writing Tips

- Every sentence should earn its place — if it doesn't inform a decision, cut it
- Use bullet points for scanability
- Bold key numbers and conclusions
- No hedging — take a clear position
- Assume the reader has 3 minutes maximum
