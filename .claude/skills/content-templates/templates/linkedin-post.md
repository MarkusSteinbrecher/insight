# LinkedIn Post Template

**Target length**: 150-300 words
**Citation style**: Inline attribution (source name only)
**Tone**: Professional but personal — sharing a perspective with your network

## Frontmatter

```yaml
---
title: ""
date: YYYY-MM-DD
draft: true
type: linkedin
topic: topic-slug
tags: []
summary: ""
---
```

## Structure

### Hook (1-2 lines)
A bold statement, surprising fact, or contrarian take that stops the scroll. First line is crucial — it appears before "...see more."

### Observation (2-3 sentences)
What you've noticed, experienced, or researched. Be specific and concrete.

### Insight (2-3 sentences)
Your interpretation. What does this mean? Why does it matter? This is where your expertise shows.

### Implication or Call to Action (1-2 sentences)
What should people do with this information? Or: an open question that invites discussion.

### Hashtags (3-5)
Relevant hashtags for discoverability.

## Writing Tips

- Use line breaks liberally — dense paragraphs get skipped on LinkedIn
- Lead with insight, not background
- One idea per post — resist the urge to cover everything
- End with a question to drive comments
- Avoid jargon unless your audience expects it
- Personal anecdotes + data = high engagement

## Example Format

```
[Hook line that grabs attention]

[2-3 sentences of observation]
